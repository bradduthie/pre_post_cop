Dear Dr. Haag,

Thank you very much for your decision. We are grateful for the positive feedback provided by Reviewer 1, and for your willingness to consider the acceptance of our manuscript if Reviewers 1's remaining minor comments can be resolved.

We believe that we have fully attended to the four remaining minor comments raised by Reviewer 1, and we hope you will further consider our revised manuscript for publication in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.

All line numbers in our response refer to lines in our revised manuscript.

Sincerely,

Manuscript Authors

Reviewer 1 General Comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very interesting and well-written manuscript where the authors have used an individual-based modelling approach to address questions on the evolution of female polyandry together with mechanisms of pre- and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. This is a resubmission and I was already quite positive regarding the previous version. I am very satisfied with how the authors have responded to my comments. In particular, I am pleased with the reaction to my most critical comment, the cost implementation. Although the authors have retained their modelling approach, they justify and discuss the assumption in a much better way than previously. Overall, I have merely a few very minor remaining comments.

Author Response to Reviewer 1 General Comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We thank Reviewer 1 for their positive remarks on our manuscript, and we are pleased that they are satisfied with how we have responded to their helpful comments. We address their remaining minor comments below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer 1 Concern 1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L36: “is likely to be facilitated” sounds very weak. Compare this with the expression on line 589: [..] cannot be effectively realised if females are not polyandrous in any form...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author Response to Reviewer 1 Concern 1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have changed the quoted passage to ''requires that'' from ''is likely to facilitated when''.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer 1 Concern 2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L225: There are many things in this section that only becomes clear after having read the next ones (i.e. the phenotypic consequences of P[p], F[p] etc.) I am wondering if it wouldn’t be better to move this complete cost section to a later point (i.e. after Mating and pre-copulatory IA & Fertilisation and postcopulatory IA, but before mutation)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author Response to Reviewer 1 Concern 2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We appreciate this comment because we had similar thoughts regarding the order of Model subsections in earlier versions of this manuscript. The problem with moving the cost subsection as suggested is that the broader Model section would then no longer reflect the order of biological events in the individual-based model; in fact, the cost subsection would then be the only subsection out of place with respect to the order at which events occur. We fear that such a restructuring would cause confusion about when costs are paid in the model, so we think it is important to keep the cost subsection where it was in our previous submission.

Some key details of the phenotypic consequences of P_p, M_p, and F_p, are provided in the previous section under the general 'Model' heading (L191-L213). We also note that the implementation of costs does not actually depend on any of the subsequently explained details of mating and fertilisation; it only depends on their phenotypic values, which have already been introduced. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that readers might be confused by the lack of further detail of the effects of phenotypes on mating and fertilisation prior to an explanation of costs. 

To address this, we now highlight the reasoning for explaining costs first while alerting readers to subsequent explanation of mating and fertilisation details (L229).

Reviewer 1 Concern 3:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L269: I cannot find a description how kinship k[ij] is calculated and what values it can take?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author Response to Reviewer 1 Concern 3:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now more explicitly state that kinship can range from 0-1 (L221), and that it is calculated directly from the pedigree using standard iterative algorithms (L222-L224).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reviewer 1 Concern 4:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L405: yes I agree, but it would be possible to use statistical inferences to compare effect sizes. To cite the White et al.-paper: “While we contend that a focus on statistical significance is inappropriate, we also argue that quantitative evaluation of differences in effect size among model scenarios is entirely appropriate.” My original comment referred to the statement on line 507. Although I acknowledge that by comparing figure 4A and figure 1B (which have mean+-SD of the simulations) the reader gets all the information needed. Alternatively (or in addition), one could also state the range (or any other dispersion measure) of mean simulation values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author Response to Reviewer 1 Concern 4:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are grateful for Reviewer 1's clarification here, and we agree that statistical inferences measures (rather than statistical hypothesis testing) are still appropriate to report.

We now report the standard errors on the line indicated (now L510) along with the mean values to facilitate comparison between Figure 4A and Figure 1B.
