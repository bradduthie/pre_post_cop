Model
===================================================

We track interactions among discrete individuals in a small focal population that persists over multiple generations. Individuals within this population are either female or male, and are potentially related if they share a common ancestory. We record the coefficient of kinship ($k$), defined as the probability that a randomly selected homologous allele from each individual is identical-by-descent [@Lynch1998], between all pairs of individuals in each generation using the population pedigree [see @Boyce1983; @Duthie]. At the start of each generation, each female pays up to three independent costs of (1) tendency to engage in polyandry ($c_{P}$), (2) mating strategy with respect to inbreeding ($c_{M}$), and (3) fertilisation strategy ($c_{F}$) with respect to inbreeding. The number of males that a focal female mates with ($N_{males}$) is determined by the effects of 20 alleles ($P_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to determine a her genotype ($P_{g}$), and ultimately the phenotype for her tendency to engage in polandry ($P_{p}$). A focal female's choice of mate(s) is affected by 20 alleles ($M_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to affect her genotype ($M_{g}$) and phenotype ($M_{p}$) for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance or preference, and $k$ between the focal female and her potential mates. Similarly, after mating has occurred, post-copulatory fertilisation of a focal female's $n$ total offspring is affected by 20 alleles ($F_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to affect the genotype ($F_{g}$) and phenotype ($F_{p}$) of the degree to which fertilisation success is affected by $k$. After fertilisation, the vialbility of a focal female's $n$ offspring is decreased by inbreeding depression ($\beta$); surviving offspring become adults. After inbreeding depression in offspring, $\rho$ adult male immigrants arrive in the population, then density effects reduce the entire population down to female ($K_{f}$) and male ($K_{m}$) carrying capacity. Over generations, we record mean values of alleles underlying polyandry, mating strategy, and fertilisation strategy.

Costs
----------------------------------------------

Values of phenotypic traits for tendency to engage in polyandry ($P_{p}$), mating ($M_{p}$), and fertilistation ($F_{p}$) each have costs, which independently increase the probability of a focal female's reproductive failure. These costs are all expressed prior to mating. In the case of tendency to engage in polyandry and inbreeding mating strategy, costs of $P_{p}$ ($c_{P}$) and $M_{p}$ ($c_{M}$) are interpreted biologically as costs associated with mate searching. In the case of inbreeding fertilisation strategy, the cost of $F_{g}$ is interpreted as an energetic cost associated with the physiological or biochemical mechanisms that need to be developed to bias fertilsation for inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference. Each cost independently increases the risk of female pre-mating mortality and, because generations are non-overlapping, total reproductive failure as a linear function of its associated trait. The probability that a focal female dies before mating due to the cost of polyandry is therefore $P_{p} \times c_{P}$. Similarly, the probability of pre-mating female mortality due to the cost of mating strategy and fertilisation strategy is $|M_{p}| \times c_{M}$ and $|F_{p}| \times c_{F}$, repectively, where $|M_{p}|$ is the absolute value of $M_{p}$ and $|F_{p}|$ is the absolute value of $F_{p}$. Absolute values are used for applying costs to inbreeding strategies because both negative and positive $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ bias breeding interactions with respect to kinship, while only positive values of $P_{p}$ affect a female's tendency for polyandry; zero and negative $P_{p}$ values always translate to monandrous phenotypes (see below).

Polyandry
----------------------------------------------

Each female chooses a number of males to mate with ($N_{males}$) based on her genetically determined tendency to engage in polyandry ($P_{p}$). The exact value of $N_{males}$ is calculated by sampling from a random poisson distribution such that $N_{males} = Poisson(P_{p}) + 1$. This random sampling procedure causes some stochastic variation in the number of realised mates a that female chooses, with a mean $N_{males}$ of $P_{p}+1$. A one is added to $P_{p}$ to ensure that all females choose at least one mate, as low values of $P_{p}$ might return $Poisson(P_{p})$ values of zero.

The value of $P_{p}$ is affected by the summed values of her 20 $P_{a}$ alleles. Inheritence of all alleles models a diploid genetic architecture in which 10 $P_{a}$ alleles are randomly sampled from each parent with no physical linkage. Values of $P_{a}$ can take any real number [continuum-of-alleles model; @Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Reeve2000; @Bocedi2014]. The tendency for polyandry genotype $P_{g}$ is defined by the sum of all of a focal female's 20 $P_{a}$ values, which might be negative or positive. However, the tendency for polyandry phenotype $P_{p}$ is restricted to zero or positive values because the number of males that a female chooses to mate with cannot be negative. Hence, negative values of $P_{g}$ are translated to $P_{p}$ values of zero such that $P_{p} = 0$ when $P_{g} < 0$, but when $P_{g} \geq 0$, then $P_{p} = P_{g}$ (i.e., the phenotype value of polyandry equals the genotype value of polyandry if and only if the genotype value is greater than or equal to zero, else the phenotype value of polyandry always equals zero). The resulting $P_{p}$ is therefore modelled as a threshold trait [@Lynch1998; @Roff1996; @Roff1998], in which polyandry is expressed discretely at the threshold value of $P_{g} > 0$, but is determined by the consequence of continuous genetic variation arising from the effects of $P_{a}$ alleles that each contribute additively to a female's tendency toward polyandry. Negative genotypic values of $P_{g}$ therefore all have the same phenotype, resulting in consistently monandrous females. In contrast, positive values of $P_{g}$ and therefore $P_{p}$ can lead to different degrees of realised polyandry in the form of discrete numbers of mates ($N_{males}$).

Mating
----------------------------------------------

Each male within the population is a potential mate for any female to choose. We therefore assume that there are no opportunity costs associated with male mating such that mating with one female would reduce a male's ability to mate with and sire the offspring of any other female [e.g., @Waser1986]. While all males are therefore available as potential mates, we assume that a female mates with her total allotment of $N_{males}$ without replacement, meaning that $N_{males}$ models the total number of distinct males that a female chooses to mate with rather than the number of times that she mates. In the unlikely event that a female's $N_{males}$ exceeds the total number of males in the population, then she mates with all of the males in the populaton. Most often, $N_{males}$ will be a small subset of the available males in the population [@Duthie], so a focal female will be able to preferentially mate with males that are close kin (high $k$), distant kin (low $k$), or non-kin ($k=0$) through the expression of her mating phenotype ($M_{p}$). Like polyandry allele values, mating strategy allele values ($M_{a}$) can take any real number. However, unlike polyandry, the sum of all of a female's 20 $M_{a}$ alleles equals both her mating strategy genotype ($M_{g}$) and her mating strategy phenotype ($M_{p}$). Negative or positive values of $M_{p}$ cause a female to avoid or prefer mating with kin, respectively. Values of $M_{p}=0$ causes females to mate randomly with respect to kinship.

The probability that a focal female $i$ mates with a male $j$ with which she shares some kinship $k_{ij}$ is calculated by first assigning each male a perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$. This quality depends upon whether the female has a strategy of avoiding mating with kin ($M_{p}<0$) or preferring mating with kin ($M_{p}>0$; if $M_{p}=0$, all males are assigned a quality of 1, $Q^{m}_{ij}=1$). If a focal female avoids mating with kin, then $Q^{m}_{ij} = (-M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$, meaning that the perceived quality of a male decreases lineary with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and increasingly negative values of $M_{p}$. If a focal female prefers mating with kin, then $Q^{m}_{ij} = M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$, meaning that the perceived quality of a male increases with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and $M_{p}$. After a focal female assigns all males a perceived quality, the sum of all male perceived qualities is calculated, then each male quality is divided by this sum. This transformation results in each male having a relative perceived mate quality $q^{m}_{ij}$, which is constrained to values between zero and one. The value of $q^{m}_{ij}$ then defines the probability that a female chooses the male as a mate; female choice is therefore stochastic, meaning that females do not always choose the male of the highest $q^{m}_{ij}$. For polyandrous females that choose more than one male mate, mates are chosen iteratively such that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and $q^{m}_{ij}$ are re-calculated for each additional mate choice, and with $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and therefore $q^{m}_{ij}$ values of already chosen males set to zero to ensure mate sampling without replacement.

Fertilisation
----------------------------------------------

The fertilisation of a female's $n$ offspring occurs after mating, with each of her $n$ offspring being assigned a sire independently and with replacement from the $N_{males}$ with which the female mated. The probability that a male mate successfully sires an offspring is affected by a female's kinship with the potential sire ($k_{ij}$) and her inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{p}$). As with polyandry and inbreeding mating strategy phenotypes, a female's inbreeding fertilisation strategy phenotype is determined by the summed effects of 20 inbreeding fertilisation strategy alleles ($F_{a}$), which can take any real number. The sum of all of a female's $F_{a}$ alleles determine her inbreeding fertilisation strategy genotype ($F_{g}$), which is identical to her inbreeding strategy phenotype ($F_{p}$). As with mating strategy phenotype ($M_{p}$), negative or positive values of $F_{p}$ correspond to inbreeding avoidance or preference respectively, and $F_{p}=0$ causes random fertilisation with respect to kinship. 

The probability that an offspring of a focal female $i$ is fertilised by one of $i$'s mates $j$ is calculated by first assigning a perceived fertilisation quality to each $j$, $Q^{f}_{ij}$. Perceived fertilisation quality $Q^{f}_{ij}$ is calculated in the same way as perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$, such that if a focal female has a fertilisation strategy of avoiding inbreeding ($F_{p}<0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = (-F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$. If instead a focal female has a fertilisation strategy of preferring inbreeding ($F_{p}>0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$. The perceived qualities of every male that a focal female has mated with are summed, then a relative quality ($q^{f}_{ij}$) is calculated for each male by dividing each individual male mate's $Q^{f}_{ij}$ by this sum. As with relative perceived mate quality values ($q^{m}_{ij}$), this results in values of perceived fertilisation quality $q^{f}_{ij}$ between zero and one. These $q^{f}_{ij}$ values define the probability that the offspring of a focal female $i$ is fertilised by the male $j$. Females produce $n$ offspring, meaning that $q^{f}_{ij}$ values are sampled $n$ times for each female to determine the realised distribution of sires.
