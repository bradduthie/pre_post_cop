Abstract
===================================================



Introduction
===================================================

<!--- TODO: GENERAL PARAGRAPH INTRODUCING THE SCOPE AND KEY QUESTION --->
Reproductive decisions expressed among interacting individuals directly affect individual fitnesses and the genotypes and viabilities of resulting offspring, and thereby profoundly affect evolutionary dynamics through the differential inheritence of alleles over generations [@Pizzari2012; @Wright2013; @Wild2014; @Liao2015; @Reid2016]. For example, how often a focal female mates is a reproductive decision that can directly and indirectly affect her fitness, and potentially alter the distribution of genotypes and patterns of inheritence within a population [e.g., @Cornell2007; @Diaz2010; @Okada2015; @Roberts2015a; @Worthington2016]. Her mating frequency and expression of mate choice might be affected by the genetic quality or complementarity of available potential mates, and her choosiness might additionally be expressed after mating has taken place through post-copulatory mechanisms [@Parker1983; @Parker2006; @Kuijper2012]. Female choice might therefore be realised by evolution of multiple, potentially interdependent, behavioural and physiological phenotypes operating in tandem. However, no general modelling framework predicts the conditions under which polyandry, pre-copulatory choice, and post-copulatory choice evolve together, meaning that there are no formal hypotheses for predicting the relevance of these reproductive decisions across different biological systems.

<!--- TODO: PARAGRAGH ON INBREEDING, PRE-COP, AND POST-COP AVOIDANCE --->
Inbreeding, defined as breeding between relatives, directly affects inheritence of identical-by-descent alleles and the viability of inbred offspring, meaning that the decision to prefer, avoid, or tolerate (i.e., mate randomly with respect to relatedness) inbreeding is predicted to have profound effects on individual fitness [@Parker2006; @Kokko2006; @Szulkin2012; @Duthie2015a]. Viability of inbred offspring typically decreases with increasing relatedness between parents [termed 'inbreeding depression'; @Keller2002; @Charlesworth2009]. If inbreeding depression is sufficiently weak, selection for female inbreeding preference is predicted because inbreeding increases the reproductive success of a focal female's male relative, thereby increasing the number of identical-by-descent copies present in her offspring [@Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Kokko2006; @Duthie2015a]. However, if inbreeding depression is moderate to strong, selection for female inbreeding avoidance is predicted [Duthie and Reid *in press*; @Duthie]. Female inbreeding strategy can be enacted before or after copulation occurs [e.g., @Tuni2013; @Firman2015; @Daniel2015; @Fischer2015]. However, models of inbreeding do not consider pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy (hereafter 'inbreeding mating strategy') and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy (hereafter 'inbreeding fertilisation strategy') jointly, meaning that it is unclear when selection for either or both strategies is predicted in empirical systems. 

<!--- such as when focal females mate multiply (i.e., polyandry) to avoid inbreeding  [e.g., @Mays2008; @Brouwer2011; @Kingma2013; @Duthie] --->

<!--- TODO: PARAGRAGH ON EVOLUTION OF POLYANDRY (H1) --->
Critically, evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding strategy is precluded if females only mate with one male, meaning that evolution of polyandry is intrinsically tied to female inbreeding fertilisation strategy. Although polyandry is commonplace in wild populations, the regularity with which it is observed in the wild remains theoretically puzzling because engaging in polyandry does not necessarily increase the number of offspring that a female produces, meaning that the fitness benefits associated with polyandry are not always clear [@Parker2013; @Taylor2014]. It has been hypothesised that females can acheive a net fitness benefit if polyandry provides them with additional opportunities to adjust their inbreeding through copulations with additional males [e.g., @Tregenza2002; @Akcay2007; @Lehtonen2015]. @Duthie showed that selection for polyandry to facilitate inbreeding avoidance is sometimes predicted, but only under highly constrained conditions in which very few males are available during a female's initial mate choice but many males are available during a female's additional mate choice(s), or when expression of polyandry is conditionally expressed based on the degree of inbreeding in a female's initially chosen mate. However, @Duthie assumed that polyandrous females had no control over the assignment of paternity to their offspring. If after engaging in polyandry, females could bias paternity toward non-relatives, then selection for polyandry to avoid inbreeding might be more widely predicted [@Zeh1997]. However, no models quantify the degree to which expression of biased paternity resulting from evolving inbreeding fertilisation strategy can feedback to drive evolution of polyandry in populations of potentially inbreeding females and males with biologically realistic distributions of relatedness.

<!--- TODO: PARAGRAGH ON IDEA OF PRE VS POST COPULATORY INBREEDING STRATEGY --->
Evolution of inbreeding fertilisation stratey might increase selection for polyandry, but evolutionary feedbacks between inbreeding fertilisation strategy and polyandry might also be contingent upon evolution of inbreeding mating strategy, thereby leading to complex evolutionary dynamics between inbreeding strategies and polyandry. For example, if females can acheive their desired degree of inbreeding through mate choice alone, then subsequent polyandry and inbreeding fertilisation strategy might be superfluous for increasing female fitness. Alternatively, if females are often unsuccessful at realising their inbreeding mating strategy due to factors such as sexual conflict over mating and resulting male coercion [e.g., @Parker2006], limited kin recognition amongst potential mates [e.g., @Penn2010], or simply the inherent stochasticity associated with mate encounters or expression of mate choice based on inbreeding [e.g., @Kokko2006; @Duthie], then selection on inbreeding fertilisation strategy might occur to reinforce inbreeding mating strategy. In empirical systems where inbreeding depression is severe and inbreeding avoidance is therefore beneficial, expression of inbreeding mating strategy and inbreeding fertilisation strategy have been observed across diverse taxa [e.g., @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Firman2015; @Fischer2015; @Daniel2015]. However, no models predict *a priori* which of these inbreeding strategies should be observed when inbreeding depression is sufficiently severe to make inbreeding avoidance adaptive.

<!--- TODO: PARAGRAGH ON COSTS OF POLYANDRY, MATING, AND FERTILISATION STRATEGIES --->
Evolution of polyandry, inbreeding mating strategy, and inbreeding fertilisation strategy will ultimately be determined by the, potentially interacting, fitness benefits and costs of each phenotype. Given severe inbreeding depression, phenotypes will increase a focal female's fitness if they cause her to avoid breeding with close relatives. However, evolution of phenotypes will also be directly affected by negative selection (i.e., costs) associated with the tendency to engage in polyandry, inbreeding mating strategy, and inbreeding fertilisation strategy. For example, females with a tendency to engage in polyandry might pay a cost associated with searching or making themselves available to mates, thereby increasing their own risk of predation [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Ronkainen1994; @Koga1998]. Females that are particularly choosy in mating interactions (e.g., especially reluctant to mate with relatives) might pay a cost of increased risk of mating failure, or harm caused by sexual conflict [@Rowe1994; @Kokko2013]. Females that are choosy after mating has occurred might pay an energetic cost associated with physiological or biochemical mechanisms needed to store sperm and successfully bias fertilisation [e.g., @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Fitzpatrick2014b]. Overall, to predict evolution of polyandry and inbreeding strategies, it is therefore necessary to model costs associated with polyandry, inbreeding mating strategy, and inbreeding fertilisation strategy.

<!--- Mate searching: Lehmann2013, Kokko2006, Jamieson2009. Kin discrimination: Waser1986. Increased predation risk associated with mate search: Rowe1988, Ronkainen1994, Koga1998. Increased risk associated with expression of mate choice (e.g., avoiding male coercion): Rowe1994. Risk of not mating due to choosiness: Kokko2013


<!--- TODO: PARAGRAGH ON ORDER OF INTERACTIONS --->
Selection for inbreeding mating strategy versus inbreeding fertilisation strategy and associated polyandry might also depend evolutionary constraints, or on existing phenotypes in the population. For example, if phenotypes biasing fertilisation to avoid inbreeding are precluded by evolutionary constraints [@Bradshaw1991; @Futuyma2010], then inbreeding avoidance might only be possible before copulation occurs, perhaps strengthening selection for inbreeding mating strategy and weakening selection for polyandry. Alternatively, evolution of female inbreeding mating strategy might be precluded due to severely limited kin recognition or the inability to resist male coercion given sexual conflict [@Arnqvist2005a; @Parker2006; @Penn2010]. In such conditions, females might only be able to express choice through inbreeding fertilisation strategy, perhaps strengthening selection for inbreeding avoidance through polyandry and post-copulatory mechanisms. Selection for inbreeding mating or fertilisation strategy might also be weak or negligible if the strategy is redundant due to the presence of an already established adaptive inbreeding strategy (e.g., if females already successfully avoid inbreeding during mate encounters, then they might be unable to increase their fitness further by biasing fertilisation after mating has occurred). It is therefore necessary to consider evolution of inbreeding mating strategy and inbreeding fertilisation strategy when each evolves in a population where its complementary inbreeding strategy is evolutionarily constrained or already fixed as an adaptation.

<!--- TODO: OVERVIEW OF THE POINT OF THE MODELLING --->
Here we apply a model of female and male reproductive interactions and associated inbreeding depression in offspring viability to quantify evolution of three separate traits including female tendency for polyandry, female pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy (mating strategy), and female post-copulatory inbreeding strategy (fertilisation strategy). We use individual-based modelling and *in silico* experiments to test the hypotheses that, given inbreeding depression in offspring viability, evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance causes selection for evolution of polyandry. Additionally, we test the hypothesis that costs associated with polyandry and inbreeding strategies will strongly affect evolution of each such that that pre-copulatory but not post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will evolve when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is less costly than the combined cost of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry, while post-copulatory but not pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will evolve when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is more costly than the combined costs of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry. Finally, we test the hypothesis that constraints on evolution of one inbreeding strategy (e.g., inbreeding mating strategy) will increase the strength of selection on evolution of a complementary inbreeding strategy (e.g., inbreeding fertilisation strategy), and that evolution of one inbreeding strategy will be precluded if it is introduced into a population that is already fixed for a complementary inbreeding strategy that is adaptive. We thereby provide a framework for predicting evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance across reproductive systems with different relative costs and different magnitudes of inbreeding depression in offspring viability.


******************************

Model
===================================================

We track interactions among discrete individuals in a small focal population that persists over multiple generations. Individuals within this population are either female or male, and are potentially related if they share a common ancestory. We record the coefficient of kinship ($k$), defined as the probability that a randomly selected homologous allele from each individual is identical-by-descent [@Lynch1998], between all pairs of individuals in each generation using the population pedigree [see @Boyce1983; @Duthie]. At the start of each generation, each female pays up to three independent costs of (1) tendency to engage in polyandry ($c_{P}$), (2) mating strategy with respect to inbreeding ($c_{M}$), and (3) fertilisation strategy ($c_{F}$) with respect to inbreeding. The number of males that a focal female mates with ($N_{males}$) is determined by the effects of 20 alleles ($P_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to determine a her genotype ($P_{g}$), and ultimately the phenotype for her tendency to engage in polandry ($P_{p}$). A focal female's choice of mate(s) is affected by 20 alleles ($M_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to affect her genotype ($M_{g}$) and phenotype ($M_{p}$) for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance or preference, and $k$ between the focal female and her potential mates. Similarly, after mating has occurred, post-copulatory fertilisation of a focal female's $n$ total offspring is affected by 20 alleles ($F_{a}$) across 10 diploid loci that combine additively to affect the genotype ($F_{g}$) and phenotype ($F_{p}$) of the degree to which fertilisation success is affected by $k$. After fertilisation, the vialbility of a focal female's $n$ offspring is decreased by inbreeding depression ($\beta$); surviving offspring become adults. After inbreeding depression in offspring, $\rho$ adult male immigrants arrive in the population, then density effects reduce the entire population down to female ($K_{f}$) and male ($K_{m}$) carrying capacity. Over generations, we record mean values of alleles underlying polyandry, mating strategy, and fertilisation strategy.

Costs
----------------------------------------------


<!--- Change mating cost to an increased risk of mating failure ---> 
Values of phenotypic traits for tendency to engage in polyandry ($P_{p}$), mating ($M_{p}$), and fertilistation ($F_{p}$) each have costs, which independently increase the probability of a focal female's reproductive failure. These costs are all expressed prior to mating. In the case of tendency to engage in polyandry, the cost of $P_{p}$ ($c_{P}$) is interpreted biologically as a cost associated with mate searching or courtship [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Rowe1994; @Ronkainen1994; @Koga1998; @Lasley-Rasher2012]. For inbreeding mating strategy, the cost of $M_{p}$ ($c_{M}$) is interpreted biologically as a cost associated with risk of mating failure due to females being overly choosy [e.g., @Kokko2013], and for inbreeding fertilisation strategy, the cost of $F_{p}$ ($c_{F}$) is interpreted as an energetic cost associated with the physiological or biochemical mechanisms that need to be developed to bias fertilisation for inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference [e.g., @Gasparini2011]. Each cost independently increases the risk of female pre-mating mortality and, because generations are non-overlapping, total reproductive failure as a linear function of its associated trait. The probability that a focal female dies before mating due to the cost of polyandry is therefore $P_{p} \times c_{P}$. Similarly, the probability of pre-mating female mortality due to the cost of mating strategy and fertilisation strategy is $|M_{p}| \times c_{M}$ and $|F_{p}| \times c_{F}$, repectively, where $|M_{p}|$ is the absolute value of $M_{p}$ and $|F_{p}|$ is the absolute value of $F_{p}$. Absolute values are used for applying costs to inbreeding strategies because both negative and positive $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ bias breeding interactions with respect to kinship, while only positive values of $P_{p}$ affect a female's tendency for polyandry; zero and negative $P_{p}$ values always translate to monandrous phenotypes (see below).

Polyandry
----------------------------------------------

Each female chooses a number of males to mate with ($N_{males}$) based on her genetically determined tendency to engage in polyandry ($P_{p}$). The exact value of $N_{males}$ is calculated by sampling from a random poisson distribution such that $N_{males} = Poisson(P_{p}) + 1$. This random sampling procedure causes some stochastic variation in the number of realised mates a that female chooses, with a mean $N_{males}$ of $P_{p}+1$. A one is added to $P_{p}$ to ensure that all females choose at least one mate, as low values of $P_{p}$ might return $Poisson(P_{p})$ values of zero.

The value of $P_{p}$ is affected by the summed values of her 20 $P_{a}$ alleles. Inheritence of all alleles models a diploid genetic architecture in which 10 $P_{a}$ alleles are randomly sampled from each parent with no physical linkage. Values of $P_{a}$ can take any real number [continuum-of-alleles model; @Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Reeve2000; @Bocedi2014]. The tendency for polyandry genotype $P_{g}$ is defined by the sum of all of a focal female's 20 $P_{a}$ values, which might be negative or positive. However, the tendency for polyandry phenotype $P_{p}$ is restricted to zero or positive values because the number of males that a female chooses to mate with cannot be negative. Hence, negative values of $P_{g}$ are translated to $P_{p}$ values of zero such that $P_{p} = 0$ when $P_{g} < 0$, but when $P_{g} \geq 0$, then $P_{p} = P_{g}$ (i.e., the phenotype value of polyandry equals the genotype value of polyandry if and only if the genotype value is greater than or equal to zero, else the phenotype value of polyandry always equals zero). The resulting $P_{p}$ is therefore modelled as a threshold trait [@Lynch1998; @Roff1996; @Roff1998], in which polyandry is expressed discretely at the threshold value of $P_{g} > 0$, but is determined by the consequence of continuous genetic variation arising from the effects of $P_{a}$ alleles that each contribute additively to a female's tendency toward polyandry. Negative genotypic values of $P_{g}$ therefore all have the same phenotype, resulting in consistently monandrous females. In contrast, positive values of $P_{g}$ and therefore $P_{p}$ can lead to different degrees of realised polyandry in the form of discrete numbers of mates ($N_{males}$).

Mating
----------------------------------------------

Each male within the population is a potential mate for any female to choose. We therefore assume that there are no opportunity costs associated with male mating such that mating with one female would reduce a male's ability to mate with and sire the offspring of any other female [e.g., @Waser1986]. While all males are therefore available as potential mates, we assume that a female mates with her total allotment of $N_{males}$ without replacement, meaning that $N_{males}$ models the total number of distinct males that a female chooses to mate with rather than the number of times that she mates. In the unlikely event that a female's $N_{males}$ exceeds the total number of males in the population, then she mates with all of the males in the populaton. Most often, $N_{males}$ will be a small subset of the available males in the population [@Duthie], so a focal female will be able to preferentially mate with males that are close kin (high $k$), distant kin (low $k$), or non-kin ($k=0$) through the expression of her mating phenotype ($M_{p}$). Like polyandry allele values, mating strategy allele values ($M_{a}$) can take any real number. However, unlike polyandry, the sum of all of a female's 20 $M_{a}$ alleles equals both her mating strategy genotype ($M_{g}$) and her mating strategy phenotype ($M_{p}$). Negative or positive values of $M_{p}$ cause a female to avoid or prefer mating with kin, respectively. Values of $M_{p}=0$ causes females to mate randomly with respect to kinship.

The probability that a focal female $i$ mates with a male $j$ with which she shares some kinship $k_{ij}$ is calculated by first assigning each male a perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$. This quality depends upon whether the female has a strategy of avoiding mating with kin ($M_{p}<0$) or preferring mating with kin ($M_{p}>0$; if $M_{p}=0$, all males are assigned a quality of 1, $Q^{m}_{ij}=1$). If a focal female avoids mating with kin, then $Q^{m}_{ij} = (-M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$, meaning that the perceived quality of a male decreases lineary with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and increasingly negative values of $M_{p}$. If a focal female prefers mating with kin, then $Q^{m}_{ij} = M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$, meaning that the perceived quality of a male increases with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and $M_{p}$. After a focal female assigns all males a perceived quality, the sum of all male perceived qualities is calculated, then each male quality is divided by this sum. This transformation results in each male having a relative perceived mate quality $q^{m}_{ij}$, which is constrained to values between zero and one. The value of $q^{m}_{ij}$ then defines the probability that a female chooses the male as a mate; female choice is therefore stochastic, meaning that females do not always choose the male of the highest $q^{m}_{ij}$. For polyandrous females that choose more than one male mate, mates are chosen iteratively such that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and $q^{m}_{ij}$ are re-calculated for each additional mate choice, and with $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and therefore $q^{m}_{ij}$ values of already chosen males set to zero to ensure mate sampling without replacement.

Fertilisation
----------------------------------------------

The fertilisation of a female's $n$ offspring occurs after mating, with each of her $n$ offspring being assigned a sire independently and with replacement from the $N_{males}$ with which the female mated. The probability that a male mate successfully sires an offspring is affected by a female's kinship with the potential sire ($k_{ij}$) and her inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{p}$). As with polyandry and inbreeding mating strategy phenotypes, a female's inbreeding fertilisation strategy phenotype is determined by the summed effects of 20 inbreeding fertilisation strategy alleles ($F_{a}$), which can take any real number. The sum of all of a female's $F_{a}$ alleles determine her inbreeding fertilisation strategy genotype ($F_{g}$), which is identical to her inbreeding strategy phenotype ($F_{p}$). As with mating strategy phenotype ($M_{p}$), negative or positive values of $F_{p}$ correspond to inbreeding avoidance or preference respectively, and $F_{p}=0$ causes random fertilisation with respect to kinship. 

The probability that an offspring of a focal female $i$ is fertilised by one of $i$'s mates $j$ is calculated by first assigning a perceived fertilisation quality to each $j$, $Q^{f}_{ij}$. Perceived fertilisation quality $Q^{f}_{ij}$ is calculated in the same way as perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$, such that if a focal female has a fertilisation strategy of avoiding inbreeding ($F_{p}<0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = (-F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$. If instead a focal female has a fertilisation strategy of preferring inbreeding ($F_{p}>0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$. The perceived qualities of every male that a focal female has mated with are summed, then a relative quality ($q^{f}_{ij}$) is calculated for each male by dividing each individual male mate's $Q^{f}_{ij}$ by this sum. As with relative perceived mate quality values ($q^{m}_{ij}$), this results in values of perceived fertilisation quality $q^{f}_{ij}$ between zero and one. These $q^{f}_{ij}$ values define the probability that the offspring of a focal female $i$ is fertilised by the male $j$. Females produce $n$ offspring, meaning that $q^{f}_{ij}$ values are sampled $n$ times for each female to determine the realised distribution of sires.

Mutation
----------------------------------------------

Alleles of a focal female's offspring mutate with a probability of $\mu=0.001$, with mutation being an independent event across loci. In general, loss of function mutations might be expected to be more frequent than mutations that increase the functionality of adaptations that rely on complex physiologies or behaviours. If tendency for polyandry, inbreeding mating strategies, or inbreeding fertilisation strategies rely on such complex physiologies or behaviours, then we might expect the direction of mutation to be biased (e.g., towards monandry or random mating). However, because we are interested specifically in how selection affects reproductive strategy given varying costs and inbreeding depression, we model mutation as unbiased so that selection can be isolated and inferred clearly from mean allele values.

Hence, when a mutation occurs at a loci, a new value is sampled from a random normal distribution with a mean of zero, $\mathcal{N}(0, \mu_{SD})$. This new value is then added to the original value of the allele that mutates [@Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Bocedi2014; @Duthie]. The standard deviation of the mutation effect size ($\mu_{SD}$) is set to $\sqrt{1/20}$, which scales the variance of mutation effect size to the total number of alleles affecting $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$ phenotypes [see @Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Bocedi2014].

Inbreeding depression
----------------------------------------------

The viability of a focal female $i$'s offspring ($\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$) decreases as a function of the kinship coefficient between $i$ and the sire of her offspring $j$ ($k_{ij}$), and a log-linear slope of inbreeding depression $\beta$. We model selection as having an absolute effect on offspring viability (i.e., hard selection), rather than a relative effect on viability (i.e., soft selection), so that the effect of $\beta$ is consistent over generations and across different parameter combinations. Natural selection on tendency for polyandry ($P_{p}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($M_{p}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{p}$) can therefore be compared with respect to log-linear inbreeding depression slopes across generations and parameter combinations. If offspring viability was instead relative such that the least inbred offspring had a high viability regardless of the absolute value of $k_{ij}$, then the effect of kinship coefficients and inbreeding depression slopes on offspring viability would depend on the population-wide distribution of $k_{ij}$ between females and males, making model inference more difficult. Therefore, we define offspring viability as,
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\textrm{off}} = e^{-\beta k_{ij}}
\end{equation}
The slope $\beta$ models the number of haploid lethal equivalents that exist in the gametes of $i$ and $j$, and which might combine to become homozygous in offspring and reduce viability. Equation 1 assumes that each deleterious recessive allele affects offspring viability independently, meaning that every deleterious recessive allele added will have a multiplicative affect on decreasing viability [@Morton1956; @Mills1994], causing the log-linear relationship between parent kinship and inbreeding depression. We assume that inbreeding depression always decreases offspring viability, $\beta \geq 0$ (i.e., no outbreeding depression). Therefore, because $k_{ij}$ is constrained to values between zero and one, the product of $-\beta$ and $k_{ij}$ must be a value less than or equal to zero, $-\beta \times k_{ij} \leq 0$. Values of $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ must therefore be between zero and one. We can therefore define $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ as the probability that an offspring is viable, and sample its realised viability using a Bernoulli trial.

Immigration
----------------------------------------------

After offspring viability is realised, $\rho$ adult immigrants are added to the focal population. The coefficient of kinship between an immigrant and all other individuals (including native individuals and other immigrants) always equals zero ($k_{ij}=0$). Because kinship coefficient values are calculated directly from the pedigree of the focal population, the addition of immigrants thereby introduces non-kin into the population at a consistent rate and prevents the mean kinship coefficient of the population from asymptoting to a value of 1 over generations. If the focal population was instead closed ($\rho=0$), then all alleles would quickly be expected to become identical-by-descent among descendants of the ancestral population. To avoid having immigrants affect the evolution of tendency for polyandry ($P_{p}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($M_{p}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{p}$), immigrants are always male and can therefore be chosen based on their kinship values of zero but not actively affect reproductive decisions through the expression of $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, or $F_{p}$. To further avoid having immigrants affect evolutionary dynamics, allele values underlying tendency for polyandry ($P_{a}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($M_{a}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{a}$) are randomly sampled from normal distributions with means and standard deviations of $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, and $F_{a}$ values equal to the means and standard deviations of those in the focal population at the time of immigration. Overall, this model of immigration effectively assumes that the focal population receives immigrants from other nearby populations that are subject to the same selection on $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$.

Density regulation
----------------------------------------------

To avoid indefinite population growth over generations, we introduce a separate carrying capacity on the total number of females ($K_{f}$) and males ($K_{m}$) in the focal population following immigration [@Guillaume2009; @Duthie]. If at the end of a generation the number of females or males exceeds their respective carrying capacities, then each sex is reduced back to its $K_{f}$ or $K_{m}$ by randomly removing females and males until each sex is at its carrying capacity. Removal of females and males can be interpreted as dispersal outside the focal population, mortality, or as some combination of dispersal and mortality. The remaining females and males within the population form the next generation of adults.

Model analysis
----------------------------------------------

To analyse our model, we track mean values of alleles underlying tendency for polyandry ($P_{a}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($M_{a}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{a}$) in a focal population. We present evolutionary dynamics of these mean allele values across different combinations of inbreeding depression slopes and costs to test our four focal hypotheses (see below). The combinations of costs and inbreeding depression slopes that we consider include all eight possible permutations of values of costs of tendency for polyandry ($c_{P}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($c_{M}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($c_{F}$) equal to either $0$ or $0.02$ [@Duthie observed $0.02$ to be strong cost of tendency for polyandry], and for values of $\beta = 3$ ($8$ total combinations). In all of these simulations, we record mean values of $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, $F_{a}$ in each generation. Each of the $8$ possible cost combinations is replicated $40$ times, and grand mean values and standard deviation of means is calculated in each generation across replicate simulations. These analyses allowed us to infer how allele values change over generations in response to costs, but also in response to the changing values of other alleles and therefore potentially interacting phenotypes (e.g., selection on inbreeding fertilisation strategy might be weak if polyandry is rare).

To test our hypothesis that selection for evolution of polyandry is driven by female's ability to bias fertilisation toward inbreeding avoidance through post-copulatory mechanisms, we compare simulations in which all three phenotypes including tendency for polyandry ($P_{p}$), inbreeding mating strategy ($M_{p}$), and inbreeding fertilisation strategy ($F_{p}$) evolve, with an identical set of simulations in which $F_{p}$ cannot evolve. In simulations without evolving $F_{p}$, we therefore include all 8 combinations of $c_{P}=\{0,0.02\}$, $c_{M}=\{0,0.02\}$, $c_{F}=\{0,0.02\}$, and $\beta = 3$ replicated 40 times each. To stop $F_{p}$ from evolving, we sever the connection from $F_{a}$ to $F_{p}$ such that all $F_{g}$ genotypes resulting from $F_{a}$ cause random fertilisation with respect to kinship. Hence, while mutation and drift can still occur for $F_{a}$ alleles, these alleles have no phenotypic effect and polyandry cannot cause polyandrous females to benefit through an increased ability to bias fertilisation toward inbreeding avoidance (under such conditions, there can also never be a cost of $F_{p}$, meaning that $c_{F}=0$). By comparing evolution of mean $P_{p}$ values over generations when $F_{p}$ also evolves versus when $F_{p}=0$ (random fertilisation), we test whether or not evolution of inbreeding fertilisation strategy increases selection for evolution of polyandry.

To test hypotheses regarding evolution under different relative costs of phenotypes, we consider all combinations of costs and inbreeding depression parameter values using only simulations in which all three traits evolve. To test our hypothesis that inbreeding mating strategy will evolve toward inbreeding avoidance ($M_{p}<0$) when mating costs are low relative to the costs of tendency for polyandry and inbreeding fertilisation strategy, but that selection for inbreeding fertilisation strategy will then be negligible ($F_{p} \approx 0$), we quantify evolution of $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ over generations in simulations where $c_{M}=0$ but $c_{P}$, $c_{F}$, or both equals $0.02$ and $\beta=3$. We compare evolution in these three cost parameter value combinations with simulations in which all costs equal either $0$ or $0.02$. If our hypothesis is supported, then $M_{p}$ but not $F_{p}$ will evolve to more negative values when $c_{M}$ is relatively low than when all cost values are uniform. To test the hypothesis that inbreeding fertilisation strategy will evolve toward inbreeding avoidance ($F_{p}<0$) given low costs of polyandry and inbreeding fertilisation strategy relative to the cost of inbreeding mating strategy, but that selection on inbreeding mating strategy will be negligible ($M_{p} \approx 0$), we qualtify evolution of $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ over generations when $c_{F}=0$, $c_{P}=0$, and $c_{M}=0.02$ and $\beta=3$. We compare evolution for this combination of cost parameter values with simulations in which all costs equal either $0$ or $0.02$. If our hypothesis is supported, then $F_{p}$ but not $M_{p}$ will evolve to more negative values when $c_{F}$ is relatively low than when all cost values are uniform.

To test the hypothesis that constraints on evolution of one inbreeding strategy will increase the strength of selection on a complementary strategy, we fixed inbreeding strategy phenotypes to values of zero, thereby causing either random mating ($M_{p}=0$) or the random fertilisation of offspring ($F_{p}=0$) according to a fair raffle among mates with respect to kinship. We then compare evolution of the non-fixed trait to its evolution in simulations where all traits are allowed to evolve. In all simulations testing this hypothesis, we used strong inbreeding depression ($\beta=3$) and included $40$ replicates for each set of parameter values.

To test the hypothesis that the existence of an adaptive inbreeding strategy will decrease the strength of selection on, and thereby preclude the invasion of, a complementary strategy, we first used exploratory simulations to determine evolution of inbreeding mating strategy, and inbreeding fertilisation strategy and associated polyandry, in isolation. To test whether or not inbreeding mating avoidance was predicted to evolve when adaptive polyandry to avoid inbreeding was already established, we initiated inbreeding mating strategy allele values at zero ($M_{a}=0$), but fixed inbreeding fertilisation strategy allele values at $F_{a}=-5$ and polyandry allele values at $P_{a}=1$. Similarly, to test whether or not inbreeding fertilisation strategy evolved to avoid inbreeding, we initiated inbreeding fertilisation strategy allele values and polyandry allele values at zero ($F_{a}=0$; $P_{a}=0$), but fixed inbreeding mating strategy allele values at $M_{a}=-5$. For all simulations testing this hypothesis, we used strong inbreeding depression ($\beta=3$) and included $40$ replicates for each set of parameter values

For all replicates, we set the maximum number of generations to 10000, which exploratory simulations and previous modelling [@Duthie] showed to be a sufficient number of generations for inferring long-term dynamics of mean allele values and therefore selection on phenotypes. For all replicates, we set the number of immigrants per generation to $\rho=5$, which produced a range of kin and non-kin in each generation such that females could express inbreeding strategies. Females always produced $n=8$ offspring, which was sufficient to keep populations consistently near carrying capacities and avoid population extinction. Carrying capacities for females ($K_{f}$) and males ($K_{m}$) were both set to 100 because previous modelling has shown that populations of this size are small enough that mating encounters between kin occur with sufficient frequency for selection on inbreeding strategy, but populations are also not so small that selection is typically overwhelmed by genetic drift (Duthie and Reid *in press*).

Discussion
===================================================


<!--- The initial evolution of inbreeding fertilisation strategy might be further facilitated if the phenotypic expression of polyandry is caused by continuous genetic variation underlying a female's tendency for engaging in polyandry, as is expected for complex polygenic traits underlying behaviour under the fundamental assumptions of quantitative genetics [@Evans2008]. Under quantitative genetic assumptions, polyandry can therefore be conceptualised as a 'threshold trait', meaning that multiple mating is only realised above some threshold genetic value [@Lynch1998].
