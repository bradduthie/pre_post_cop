Abstract
===================================================

Inbreeding avoidance has been widely hypothesised to evolve through pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms as a consequence of inbreeding depression in offspring viability and female multiple mating (polyandry). However, no theoretical framework exists from which to derive hypotheses concerning joint evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance necessitates polyandry, potentially leading to complex evolutionary dynamics among inbreeding strategies and female mating frequency, each of which might be affected by direct negative costs. We use individual-based modelling to quantify evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry across multiple cost combinations given severe inbreeding depression. We find that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance increases selection for polyandry, that selection for costly inbreeding strategies was weak or negligible given a non-costly alternative strategy. Established pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance generally precluded evolution of polyandry and therefore inbreeding avoidance, but established post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance from evolving. We thereby provide a general framework for understanding joint evolution of pre-copulatory and/or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and conclude that evolution of inbreeding avoidance phenotypes and associated polyandry are predicted to interact and be strongly affected by direct costs.


Introduction
===================================================

Inbreeding, defined as reproduction between relatives, often greatly reduces the fitness of resulting inbred offspring [termed 'inbreeding depression'; @Charlesworth1999; @Keller2002; @Charlesworth2009]. Such strong inbreeding depression is widely hypothesised to drive evolution of inbreeding avoidance, which can be enacted through multiple interacting reproductive strategies [@Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Pusey1996; @Szulkin2012]. From the perspective of a focal breeding female, inbreeding avoidance might be achieved by avoiding mating with related males (i.e., pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance), or by biasing fertilisation towards unrelated males after mating has occurred (i.e., post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance). Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance requires that females express some non-trivial degree of polyandry, defined as mating with multiple males during a single reproductive bout. Further, given inbreeding depression, such polyandry might itself be under selection and evolve if it allows females to mate with additional unrelated males following an initial mating with a relative. Polyandry can thereby facilitate pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance even without any post-copulatory female choice or otherwise biased fertilisation among sperm provided by females' mates (i.e., 'fair raffle'). Overall, polyandry can therefore simultaneously allow females to mate with less closely related males and create the opportunity for further inbreeding avoidance enacted through active post-copulatory choice, and has consequently been widely hypothesised to evolve as an adaptation to allow females to avoid inbreeding and thereby increase offspring fitness [@Zeh1997; @Jennions2000; @Tregenza2002]. Resulting indirect selection on polyandry could explain its evolution in cases where multiple mating does not increase female reproductive success, or even where polyandry reduces reproductive success and therefore imposes direct fitness costs to polyandrous females. However, despite such widely-invoked hypotheses, there is surprising little theory or modelling that critically examines the conditions under which pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, or both strategies, are predicted to evolve, or that examines how the evolution of such strategies of inbreeding avoidance might feed back to affect underlying evolution of polyandry.

Despite a paucity of theory and resulting predictions, numerous empirical studies on diverse species have found evidence for female inbreeding avoidance. However, only a few such studies have determined whether inbreeding avoidance is enacted through pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mechanisms. Among these few studies, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has been documented in weevils, birds, and butterflies [e.g., @Kuriwada2011; @Kingma2013; @Fischer2015], and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has been documented in birds and crickets [e.g., @Pizzari2004; @Simmons2006; @Bretman2009]. An even smaller number of studies comprise sufficient evidence for mechanisms of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance in two well-studied species, including Trinidadian guppies [*Poecilia reticulata*; @Gasparini2011; @Daniel2015] and house mice [*Mus domesticus*; @Potts1991; @Firman2015]. A lack of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding has been found in fruit flies [e.g., @Ala-Honkola2011; @Tan2012], and might be reasonably inferred where no evidence of inbreeding avoidance exists [e.g., @Reid2014; @Reid2015]. To our knowledge, only @Liu2014 consider both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance jointly, finding evidence of pre-copulatory, but not post-copulatory, inbreeding avoidance in cabbage beetles (*Colaphellus bowringi*). Taken together, all of these studies demonstrate that diverse combinations of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occur in nature. However, there is as yet no theory that predicts what combinations should be favoured by selection when polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can all potentially evolve. Consequently, there is no theory that allows the diversity of existing empirical results to be rationalised or interpreted, and no clear hypotheses that could be tested with these studies through comparative analyses or that could be applied to future empirical studies of individual systems. 

A recent genetically-explicit individual-based model examined the conditions under which polyandry is predicted to evolve solely due to selection stemming from pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance [@Duthie]. Evolution of polyandry occurred only under highly restricted conditions, requiring that direct negative selection (i.e., 'costs') on polyandry were small, that very few males were available for a female's initial mate choice but many were available for additional mate choice(s), or that polyandry was conditionally expressed when a focal female was related to her initial mate [@Duthie]. Without these conditions, increasing polyandry tended to increase rather than decrease the overall degree of inbreeding that females experienced, and hence reduced offspring fitness. This occurred because, once pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved, polyandrous females had already chosen available unrelated males as their initial mates. Their additional mates, chosen from the remaining male population, were therefore increasingly likely to include relatives. Evolution of polyandry purely to facilitate pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and hence the resulting degree of inbreeding avoidance, was consequently restricted [@Duthie].

However, if post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could also evolve, polyandrous females could further bias paternity towards unrelated males within their set of chosen mates. Post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might consequently reduce the cost of polyandry stemming from the accumulation of related mates, potentially facilitating evolution of polyandry to avoid inbreeding under broader conditions, and driving further consequent evolution of pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mate choice strategies. However, once both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and resulting polyandry, can all evolve, the long-term dynamics of these reproductive strategies become difficult to conceptualise and predict. Strong inbreeding depression might drive initial evolution of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry. However, if evolution of polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance renders pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance redundant, or vice versa, then only one inbreeding avoidance strategy might be maintained in the long-term.

The few previous models that considered the evolution of inbreeding avoidance through mate choice (as opposed to dispersal) have implicitly or explicitly considered the fate of a rare allele underlying pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance in a population initially fixed for random mating [e.g., @Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Duthie; @Duthie2016a]. Such models are useful for isolating the invasion fitness of this single strategy. However, when both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory strategies can affect realised inbreeding, it cannot be assumed that both strategies will simultaneously invade a randomly mating population, nor that the invasion fitness of one strategy will be independent of the existence of invasion fitness of the other strategy. For example, if pre-adaptation or rapid selection results in the fixation of alleles underlying adaptive pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, then new alleles underlying polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might be precluded from invading a population because the phenotypic effect of such alleles on the degree of inbreeding could be negligible. Conversely, fixation of alleles underlying polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might eliminate positive selection on alleles underlying pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. New theory, guided by modelling that evaluates invasion dynamics given appropriate sets of evolutionary constraints, is therefore needed.

Ultimately, the absolute and relative frequencies of alleles underlying pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry will depend not only on the magnitudes of positive indirect selection stemming from reduced inbreeding depression in females' offspring, but also on the magnitudes of direct negative selection on resulting phenotypes (i.e., the direct fitness costs of expressing each reproductive strategy). Polyandrous females can pay costs of mate searching or mating, for example, because these activities increase predation risk [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Ronkainen1994; @Koga1998]. Females that express pre-copulatory choice and consequent reluctance to mate with relatives might pay costs of increased risk of complete mating failure or harm caused by sexual conflict [@Rowe1994; @Kokko2013]. Females that express post-copulatory choice might pay energetic costs associated with physiological or biochemical mechanisms needed to store sperm and successfully bias fertilisation [e.g., @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Fitzpatrick2014b]. If the relative costs of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance differ, then alleles underlying the less costly strategy might become fixed over generations, while alleles underlying the more costly inbreeding strategy might become extinct if their effects are both costly and made redundant by the less costly strategy. However, such trajectories will also depend on the indirect benefits of each strategy, which might also differ and vary in relation to the evolution of the other strategy. Dynamic models are consequently required to understand and predict evolutionary outcomes.

We address three key questions for predicting evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry given strong inbreeding depression. These questions include: (1) Does evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitate evolution of polyandry that is otherwise severely constrained from increasing relatedness of additional mates? (2) How do costs associated with polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance affect evolutionary outcomes and, in particular, the long-term persistence of reproductive strategies given cost asymmetry? Finally, (3) how is selection for initially rare pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance affected if the other strategy of inbreeding avoidance is already fixed? By addressing these questions, we provide a framework for exploring the simultaneous evolution of multiple reproductive strategies through the use of individidual-based modelling, and we derive hypotheses amenable to empirical tests within and across taxa.


******************************

Model
===================================================

We model evolution of polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance by tracking the dynamics of alleles underlying reproductive strategies enacted by interacting females and males within a small focal population. Individuals are defined as related if they share a common ancestor within the population pedigree (i.e., non-zero kinship). Each individual has 10 diploid loci, and therefore 20 alleles, underlying each of the three reproductive strategy traits (i.e., 30 total diploid loci): tendency for polyandry ($P_{a}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($M_{a}$, i.e., 'mating' alleles), and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($F_{a}$, i.e., 'fertilisation' alleles). All alleles can take any real number [i.e., a continuum-of-alleles model; @Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Reeve2000; @Bocedi2014] and combine additively to affect genotypes ($P_{g}$, $M_{g}$, and $F_{g}$) and phenotypes ($P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$) for each of the three traits whereby an individual's genotypic values $P_{g}$, $M_{g}$, and $F_{g}$ equal the sum of its 20 alleles for each trait. In overview, each generation proceeds with females paying costs, expressing polyandry, mating, and fertilisation. Offspring inherit a randomly sampled allele from each parent at each locus with no physical linkage. Alleles can then mutate and offspring express inbreeding depression. Immigrants arrive in the population and density regulation limits population growth. Key individual traits, parameter values, and variables are described in Table 1.

Costs
----------------------------------------------

Phenotypic values for tendency for polyandry ($P_{p}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($M_{p}$), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($F_{p}$) each have costs that are assumed to independently increase the probability that a focal female will die before mating. The probabilities of pre-mating mortality due to the costs of polyandry ($c_{P}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($c_{M}$), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($c_{F}$) are $P_{p} \times c_{P}$, $|M_{p}| \times c_{M}$, and $|F_{p}| \times c_{F}$, respectively. Here $|M_{p}|$ and $|F_{p}|$ are the absolute values of $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$, respectively. Absolute values are used for applying costs to inbreeding strategies because both negative and positive $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ values affect the degree of inbreeding. In contrast, only positive values of $P_{p}$ cause females to be polyandrous (see below). Overall, because generations are non-overlapping, a female's probability of total reproductive failure increases linearly with each trait value.

Polyandry
----------------------------------------------

After costs are paid, each remaining female chooses $N_{males}$ males to mate with, where $N_{males}$ is calculated by sampling from a Poisson distribution such that $N_{males} = Poisson(P_{p}) + 1$. This ensures that all surviving females choose at least one mate, and causes some stochastic variation around the expected mean $N_{males}$ of $P_{p}+1$. A female's value of $P_{p}$ depends on the sum of her 20 $P_{a}$ allele values (i.e., $P_{g}$), which might be negative or positive. However, because females cannot mate with a negative number of males, $P_{p}$ is constrained to be zero or positive such that $P_{p} = 0$ when $P_{g} < 0$, but $P_{p} = P_{g}$ when $P_{g} \geq 0$. Polyandry is therefore modelled as a threshold trait [@Lynch1998; @Roff1996; @Roff1998; @Duthie] that is influenced by continuous genetic variation but only expressed when $P_{g} > 0$. Any negative $P_{g}$ value therefore generates phenotypic monandry, while positive $P_{g}$ values can lead to different degrees of realised polyandry (i.e., different numbers of mates, $N_{males}$).

Mating and pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance
----------------------------------------------

All males in the population are assumed to be available for any female to choose. We therefore assume that there is no opportunity cost of male mating such that mating with one female would reduce a male's availability to mate with any other female. Individual females mate with their total allotment of $N_{males}$ without replacement, meaning that $N_{males}$ models a female's total number of different mates rather than solely her total number of matings.

Most often, $N_{males}$ will be smaller than the total number of available males [@Duthie]. Each female then chooses her $N_{males}$ mates based on her pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance phenotype ($M_{p}$), which equals her genotype ($M_{g}$). Negative or positive $M_{p}$ values cause a female to avoid or prefer mating with kin, respectively, whereas $M_{p}=0$ cause females to mate randomly with respect to kinship.

To calculate the probability that a focal female $i$ mates with a male $j$ to whom she is related by some kinship $k_{ij}$, each male is first assigned a perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$. If the female has a strategy of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($M_{p}<0$), then $Q^{m}_{ij} = (-M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$, meaning that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ decreases linearly with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and increasingly negative values of $M_{p}$. If the female has a strategy of pre-copulatory inbreeding preference ($M_{p}>0$), then $Q^{m}_{ij} = M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$, meaning that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ increases with increasingly positive $k_{ij}$ and $M_{p}$. If $M_{p}=0$, then all males are assigned $Q^{m}_{ij}=1$.

Each male's value with respect to each focal female is then divided by the sum of all $Q^{m}_{ij}$ values across all males with respect to that female, thereby assigning each male a relative perceived quality $q^{m}_{ij}$, which is constrained to values between zero and one. The value of $q^{m}_{ij}$ then defines the probability that a focal female mates with the male. Mating is realised by placing each $q^{m}_{ij}$ value into a vector whose elements sum to unity, and a random uniform number is then generated to sample a single male from this vector. Mating is therefore stochastic, and females do not always mate with the male of the highest $q^{m}_{ij}$. For polyandrous females that choose multiple mates (i.e., $N_{mates}>1$), mates are chosen iteratively such that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and $q^{m}_{ij}$ are re-calculated for each additional mate choice, and with $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and therefore $q^{m}_{ij}$ values of already chosen males set to zero to ensure mate sampling without replacement. In the unlikely event that a female's $N_{males}$ exceeds the total number of available males, then she simply mates with all males.

Fertilisation and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance
----------------------------------------------

Following mating, fertilisation occurs such that each of a female's $n$ offspring is independently assigned a sire (with replacement) from the $N_{males}$ with which the female mated. Sire identity depends on female's kinship with each mate ($k_{ij}$) and her post-copulatory inbreeding strategy phenotype ($F_{p}$), which equals her genotype ($F_{g}$). Negative and positive values of $F_{p}$ correspond to post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance or preference, respectively, whereas $F_{p}=0$ causes random fertilisation with respect to kinship. 

The probability that an offspring of a focal female $i$ is sired by any one of $i$'s mates $j$ is calculated by assigning a perceived fertilisation quality to each $j$ with respect to $i$, $Q^{f}_{ij}$. Perceived fertilisation quality $Q^{f}_{ij}$ is calculated in the same way as perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$, such that if a focal female has a strategy of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($F_{p}<0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = (-F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$. If the focal female has strategy of post-copulatory inbreeding preference ($F_{p}>0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$. A relative quality ($q^{f}_{ij}$) is then calculated for each male by dividing his $Q^{f}_{ij}$ by the sum of the $Q^{f}_{ij}$ values across all of a female's mates. These $q^{f}_{ij}$ values, which lie between zero and one, define the probability of paternity. As with mate choice, $q^{f}_{ij}$ values are placed into a vector whose elements sum to unity, and a random uniform number is used to sample paternity. Females produce $n$ offspring, so $q^{f}_{ij}$ values are sampled $n$ times independently and with replacement for each female to determine the realised distribution of sires. 


Mutation
----------------------------------------------

Offsprings' alleles mutate with independent probabilities $\mu=0.001$. When a mutation occurs, a mutation effect is sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of $\mu_{SD}$ and added to the original allele value [@Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Bocedi2014; @Duthie]. The value of $\mu_{SD}$ is set to $\sqrt{1/20}$.

Inbreeding depression
----------------------------------------------

The viability of a focal female $i$'s offspring ($\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$) decreases as a log-linear function of her kinship with the sire $j$ of her offspring ($k_{ij}$) and inbreeding depression slope $\beta$,
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\textrm{off}} = e^{-\beta k_{ij}}
\end{equation}
Here, $\beta$ models the number of haploid lethal equivalents that exist as deleterious recessive alleles in the gametes of $i$ and $j$, and which might be homozygous in offspring and reduce viability. Equation 1 assumes independent allelic effects, generating multiplicative effects on offspring viability [@Morton1956; @Mills1994]. We model inbreeding depression as having an absolute rather than relative effect on offspring viability (i.e., hard rather than soft selection), so that the effect of $\beta$ is consistent across generations and different parameter combinations. We also assume that inbreeding always decreases offspring viability (i.e., $\beta > 0$, no outbreeding depression). Therefore, because $0 \leq k_{ij} \leq 1$, $-\beta \times k_{ij} \leq 0$. Values of $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ must therefore be between zero (if $-\beta \times k_{ij}$ is very negative) and one (if $-\beta \times k_{ij} = 0$). We therefore define $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ as the probability that an offspring is viable, and sample its realised viability (versus mortality) using a Bernoulli trial.

Immigration
----------------------------------------------

After offspring mortality, $\rho$ adult immigrants are added to the focal population. The kinship between an immigrant and all other individuals always equals zero ($k_{ij}=0$). Immigration therefore prevents the mean kinship within the population from asymptoting to one over generations. To ensure that immigrants do not directly affect genotypic or phenotypic values of tendency for polyandry or pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, immigrants are always male. Consequently, they can be chosen as females' mates based on their values of $k_{ij}=0$ but do not actively affect reproductive decisions through the expression of $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, or $F_{p}$. Further, immigrants' $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, and $F_{a}$ allele values are randomly sampled from normal distributions with means and standard deviations equal to those in the focal population at the time of immigration, meaning that they do not directly cause any change in the distribution of allele values. We thereby effectively assume that the focal population receives immigrants from other nearby populations that are subject to the same selection on $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$.

Density regulation
----------------------------------------------

To avoid unrestricted population growth, we set separate carrying capacities for the total numbers of females ($K_{f}$) and males ($K_{m}$) in the focal population following immigration [@Guillaume2009; @Duthie]. If at the end of a generation the number of females or males exceeds $K_{f}$ or $K_{m}$  respectively, then individuals are randomly removed until each sex is at its carrying capacity. Such removal can be interpreted as some combination of dispersal and mortality. The remaining females and males form the next generation of potentially breeding adults.

Simulation and analysis
----------------------------------------------

To address whether or not evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can facilitate evolution of polyandry, we compare simulations in which polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can all evolve, with otherwise identical simulations in which post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance cannot evolve given four different costs of polyandry ($c_{P} = \{0, 0.0025, 0.005,  0.01\}$). To prevent post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance from evolving, we sever the connection from $F_{a}$ to $F_{p}$ such that all $F_{g}$ genotypes cause random fertilisation with respect to kinship, so $F_{a}$ alleles have no phenotypic effect.

To address how asymmetric costs associated with pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry affect the long-term persistence of reproductive strategies, we quantify change in $M_{a}$ and $F_{a}$ over generations in simulations where the cost of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy $c_{M}=0$ but the cost of post-copulatory inbreeding strategy $c_{F}=0.02$, and vice versa. We compare these simulations with evolution of a costly strategy in the absence of evolution of an alternative strategy (e.g., evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy when post-copulatory inbreeding strategy phenotype is fixed at zero, $F_{p}=0$). In Supporting Information, we present results for all possible cost combinations of $0$ and $0.02$.

To address how selection on an initially rare strategy of pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is affected by the existence of the other strategy of inbreeding avoidance already being fixed, we first used exploratory simulations to quantify evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy, and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy and associated polyandry, in isolation. Then, to test whether pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance would evolve when adaptive polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was already established, we initiated $M_{a}$ allele values at zero, but fixed $F_{a}$ allele values at $-10$ and $P_{a}$ allele values at $1$ (i.e., meaning that $F_{p}$ and $P_{p}$ did not evolve). Similarly, to test whether post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance would evolve when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was already established, we initiated $F_{a}$ and $P_{a}$ allele values at zero but fixed $M_{a}$ allele values at $-10$. Consequently, because females have 10 diploid loci, when $M_{a}$ or $F_{a}$ alleles were fixed at $-10$, outbred females were $51$ times less likely to choose a full brother and $13.5$ times times less likely to choose a first cousin than a non-relative in pre-copulatory and post-copulatory choice, respectively.

In all simulations, we recorded mean values of $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, and $F_{a}$ in each generation, and we present these values over generations to infer selection on phenotypes ($P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$). Each combination of parameter values simulated was replicated $40$ times, and grand mean values and standard errors of means are calculated in each generation across replicates. These analyses allowed us to infer how allele values changed over generations in response to costs, but also in response to the changing values of other alleles and therefore potential evolutionary feedbacks among reproductive strategies (e.g., selection on post-copulatory inbreeding strategy might be weak if polyandry is rare). For all replicates, we set the maximum number of generations to 40000, which exploratory simulations and previous modelling [@Duthie] showed to be sufficient for inferring long-term dynamics of mean allele values and therefore selection on phenotypes.  For all replicates, we set $\rho=5$ immigrants, which produced a range of kin and non-kin in each generation allowing females to express inbreeding strategies, and $n=8$ offspring, which was sufficient to keep populations consistently at carrying capacities and avoid population extinction. Values of $K_{f}$ and $K_{m}$ were both set to 100 because previous modelling showed that populations of this size are small enough that mate encounters between kin occur with sufficient frequency for selection on inbreeding strategy, but not so small that selection is typically overwhelmed by genetic drift [@Duthie2016a].

Results
===================================================


Does evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitate evolution of costly polyandry?
----------------------------------------------

When post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alleles ($F_{a}$) were fixed to zero, meaning that $F_{p}$ could not evolve, $P_{a}$ alleles underlying polyandry always decreased to negative values over generations (Figure 1A,C,E,G). This shows that despite strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, there is selection against unconditional polyandry even given zero direct cost ($c_{P}=0$; Figure 1A). This is because values of the $M_{a}$ also evolved to be negative, meaning that females typically avoided inbreeding through their initial mating. Polyandrous females that subsequently sampled more males from the available population were consequently more likely to mate with some relatives and hence produce some inbred offspring with low viability [@Duthie]. 

When post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was allowed to evolve, mean $P_{a}$ values became substantially higher than in comparable simulations where $F_{a}$ values were fixed to zero and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could not evolve (Figure 1B,D,F,H). Allowing evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance therefore facilitated evolution of polyandry. However, $P_{a}$ values were expected to be positive only given a low cost of polyandry ($c_{P} < 0.005$, Figure 1B,D). This implies that, even given strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, inbreeding avoidance might generally be a weak force driving polyandry evolution.

Strong post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, manifested as very negative $F_{a}$ values, consistently evolved in all simulations where such evolution was allowed (Figure 1B,D,F,H). Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurred even when $P_{a}$ values were expected to be slightly negative, and hence when there was selection against polyandry, (Figure 1F,H). This reflects the threshold nature of phenotypic expression of polygenic polyandry, wherein random sampling of alleles means that polyandry is commonly expressed (i.e., $P_{g}>0$) even when mean $P_{a}$ values are negative (Figure 2). This means that, even in populations where female reproductive strategy evolves toward monandry, there is still commonly some opportunity for expression of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated selection that drives evolution of $F_{a}$ allele values.

Strong pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved (i.e., $M_{a}<0$) in all simulations, irrespective of $c_{P}$ and irrespective of whether post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was allowed to evolve or hence whether polyandry evolved (Figure 1). This might be expected given strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, which imposes selection against inbreeding.

How do cost asymmetries affect long-term persistence of reproductive strategies?
----------------------------------------------

When either pre-copulatory ($M_{a}$) or post-copulatory ($F_{a}$) inbreeding avoidance allele values were fixed to zero, the alternative inbreeding strategy evolved to inbreeding avoidance even when costly (Figure 3A,C). Females therefore evolved to avoid inbreeding, and thereby avoid the cost of producing inbred offspring, through whichever route was available. 

However, when both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could evolve, their relative evolutionary dynamics depended on their relative costs. When one inbreeding strategy had zero cost, the other strategy initially evolved towards inbreeding avoidance (i.e., negative $M_{a}$ or $F_{a}$) but then evolved back towards random mating or fertilisation (i.e., $M_{a}=0$ or $F_{a}=0$) across generations following increasing evolution of inbreeding avoidance through the cost-free strategy (Figure 3B,D). 

Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitated evolution of polyandry (Figure 3B,C), while monandry evolved in the absence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3A,D; polyandry was cost free in all these simulations). 

How is evolution of one inbreeding strategy affected by the existence of another already adaptive strategy?
----------------------------------------------

When polyandry alleles ($P_{a}$) were fixed to be positive so that all females were expected to mate multiply and post-copulatory inbreeding allele ($F_{a}$) values were fixed for adaptive inbreeding avoidance, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved (i.e., $M_{a}$ values became increasingly negative; Figure 4A). Such evolution still occurred, but to a much smaller degree, when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was costly (Figure 4B). However, after $40000$ generations, $M_{a}$ values were less negative when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry were fixed at non-zero values than when they also evolved from initial values of zero (e.g., compare the blue lines in Figures 4A versus Figure 1A).

Conversely, when pre-copulatory inbreeding allele ($M_{a}$) values were fixed for adaptive inbreeding avoidance, mean $F_{a}$ allele values did not consistently become negative over generations (Figure 4C,D). However, in this case, mean $P_{a}$ allele values consistently decreased over generations, reflecting selection against polyandry regardless whether or not post-copulatory inbreeding strategy was costly (Figure 4C,D). Consequently, when $c_{F}=0$, $F_{a}$ allele values had no effect because females were almost exclusively monandrous, resulting in high drift of $F_{a}$ values among replicates (illustrated by wide standard errors, Figure 4C). However, when $c_{F}=0.02$, $F_{a}$ values remained near zero to minimise direct costs. This lack of selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was driven by a lack of polyandry, and therefore an inability of females to bias fertilisation among multiple mates. When pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry were both fixed ($M_{a}=-10$ and $P_{a}=1$), $F_{a}$ allele values evolved to similarly negative means as $M_{a}$ allele values in Figure 4A,B (see Supporting Information).

Discussion
===================================================

Evolution of reproductive strategies cannot be presumed to occur in isolation in wild populations, meaning that observed patterns of reproductive strategy within and across taxa are likely to be affected by evolutionary feedbacks and (potentially asymmetric) costs. We have addressed key questions regarding the effect of such feedbacks and costs on evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and polyandry. A critical analysis of our model engenders new predictions concerning evolutionary dynamics given the joint evolution of these traits, which may be used to formulate new empirical hypotheses within and across taxa.

For example, our results highlight a fundamental but theoretically under-developed relationship between evolution of female mating frequency and pre-copulatory versus post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is useless for monandrous females, and most effective for highly polyandrous females that can choose amongst multiple mates to ensure that offspring are fertilised favourably. In contrast, pre-copulatory mechanisms are most salient for monandrous females that have no post-copulatory means for avoiding inbreeding. This theory is borne out in our simulation results, as selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was negligible in monandrous populations, resulting in high drift of allele values over generations due to the inability of females to express post-copulatory choice (e.g., Figure 4C,D). The effect of monandry on selection for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was weaker, but pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was generally stronger when populations where monandrous (e.g., Figure 3A vs 3B; see also Supporting Information p. S1-1). In addition to polyandry increasing selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, polyandry might also covary positively with post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance due to the feed back that post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has on facilitating evolution of polyandry itself, as observed in our model (Figure 1). It would therefore be interesting to test the hypothesis that, across taxa, occurrence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance covaries positively, and pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance covaries negatively, with degree of polyandry. To test this hypothesis, more work is needed to identify the degree to which females of different species engage in polyandry and the degree to which females express both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance.

Another general inference from our simulation results concerns the dynamics of phenotypes with highly overlapping effects with respect to selection, as realised through functionally different traits. The ability of structurally different phenotypes to perform the same adaptive function is an example of 'degeneracy', a term which defines a more general phenomenon whereby unique elements of a system result in identical outputs [@Edelman2001]. Effects of degeneracy can be observed across nearly all biological scales [@Edelman2001], including complex systems affecting organismal development [e.g., @Nowak1997], adaptation [@Whitacre2010; @Whitacre2010a], and cognition [@Price2002; @Park2013], as well as population [@Atamas2009], community [@Suraci2017], and ecosystem [e.g., @Levin2008] dynamics. In the context of reproductive strategy, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, typically expressed through mating behaviour, versus post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, typically expressed through phenotypes affecting fertilisation, are both driven by the shared selective pressure of inbreeding depression in offspring viability. Hence, degeneracy occurred in our model through an overlap in how phenotypes cause adaptive inbreeding avoidance. Such degeneracy might increase biological robustness [@Gardner2006; @Whitacre2010a], potentially facilitating realised inbreeding avoidance across environments in which either pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mechanisms alone would be ineffective (e.g., due to sexual conflict affecting mate choice or injury affecting fertilisation). However, evolution of each of these strategies might decrease selection on the other strategy by modifying its impact on the degree to which a female avoids inbreeding and consequently has offspring that express inbreeding depression [*sensu* evolution of genetic redundancy; see @Nowak1997]. The relevance of degeneracy with respect to such reproductive strategies therefore requires further theoretical development, which could result in new empirical predictions and conceptual synthesis across biological scales.


Interaction of polyandry and inbreeding avoidance strategies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurred in our model, but was affected by the joint evolution of polyandry and the existence of asymmetric costs. One cost free inbreeding strategy precluded another more costly inbreeding strategy from persisting in a focal population by modifying its effect on inbreeding avodance (Figure 3). Consequently, long-term persistence of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might not be expected in populations given sufficient cost asymmetry. Direct costs therefore strongly affected the evolution of the costly phenotype(s), meaning that quantifying costs is necessary for predicting evolution of phenotypes associated with inbreeding strategies. Quantifying direct costs of phenotypes associated with polyandry and mate choice is empirically challenging [@Pomiankowski1987; @Kokko2003; @Reid2015]. @Pomiankowski1987 categorised four types of costs that are relevant to mate choice, which we suggest are also relevant costs for polyandry, and include costs of elevated risks associated with (1) predation or (2) disease transmission, and costs incurred through (3) loss of time or (4) depletion of energy. Another type of cost relevant for polyandry and inbreeding strategy is risk of male harm caused by sexual conflict [e.g., @Arnqvist2005a; @Parker2006]. We assumed that males were passive in mating encounters with females, but inbreeding theory predicts that males should benefit from a higher tolerance of inbreeding than females, leading to sexual conflict over inbreeding [@Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Kokko2006; @Duthie2015a]. Here we interpreted a cost of polyandy as an elevated risk of predation as might be incurred while searching for or courting mates [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Rowe1994], a cost of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy as a lost of time [i.e., risk of not finding a mate in time due to choosiness; e.g., @Kokko2013], and a cost of post-copulatory inbreeding strategy as depletion of energy. While these costs are biologically realistic, different costs will be relevant for different populations and be realised in different ways. For example, increased risk of disease transmission has been observed for highly polyandrous females [@Roberts2015a], but such a cost would more realistically be applied to the number of realised mates a female has rather than her tendency for engaging in polyandry. Different types of costs might affect selection both directly and indirectly through interactions between reproductive strategies, thereby affecting evolution of entire reproductive systems. Evolution of individual phenotypes therefore needs to be considered in the broader context of potentially interacting and phenotypes and their costs.

In our model, existence of adaptive pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance precluded evolution of polyandry and, in turn, evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3C,D). However, existence of adaptive post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3A,B). In wild populations, it is unlikely that pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will evolve simultaneously from an ancestral population in which females mate and assign paternity randomly. Rather, for example, initial evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is much more likely to evolve in the absence of evolving post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance due to constraints, or in the presence of already evolved post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. When framing hypotheses for existence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry, it might therefore be necessary to consider whether or not inbreeding avoidance already occurs through pre-copulatory mate choice. Additionally, the opportunity for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will also naturally depend on the degree to which females are polyandrous. For species in which pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurs and monandry is common [@Lihoreau2007; @Metzger2010; @Metzger2010a], evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is highly unlikely. 


Evolution of polyandry
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The opportunity to adjust inbreeding has been widely considered as a driver of adaptive evolution of polyandry [@Tregenza2002; @Foerster2003; @Akcay2007; @Varian-Ramos2012; @Kingma2013; @Lehtonen2015; @Reid2014]. We found that when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could evolve, selection for polyandry was greatly strengthened (Figure 1). The proposition that polyandry might facilitate cryptic female choice among males of varying compatibility is not new [e.g., @Zeh1997], but our model provides support for this verbal hypothesis and therefore has widespread implications for future studies of evolution of polyandry. 

We predict evolution of polyandry in populations where inbreeding depression is severe and evolution of inbreeding avoidance through post-copulatory mechanisms is not constrained. Post-copulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance have been observed under these conditions in experimental systems across diverse taxa [e.g., @Pizzari2004; @Firman2008; @Bretman2009; @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Firman2015]. Recent studies have shown how females can successfully bias fertilisation after mating has occurred. For example, when female guppies (*Poecilia reticulata*) were artificially inseminated with equal quantities of sperm from full-siblings and unrelated males, more eggs were fertilised by unrelated males because the velocities of full siblings' sperm were reduced by females' ovarian fluids [@Gasparini2011]. In black field crickets (*Teleogryllus commodus*), females attempt to remove the spermatophores of unwanted males after copulation, and are capable of controlling sperm transfer to spermatheca after copulation occurs [@Bussiere2006; @Tuni2013]. Our results suggest that evolution of such post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might increase selection for further polyandry, especially if pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is costly (Figure 1).


Conclusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution of reproductive strategies involves multiple potentially interacting and degenerate phenotypes. Here we modelled evolution of three reproductive strategies including polyandry, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, focusing on three key questions. Using individual-based modelling, we found that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitated evolution of polyandry, that evolution of a costly inbreeding avoidance strategy was inhibited when the other inbreeding avoidance strategy was cost free, and that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance but not pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was precluded when the other inbreeding avoidance strategy was fixed for strong inbreeding avoidance. We thereby conclude that evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies and associated polyandry are likely to interact in predictable ways, potentially generating new hypotheses concerning evolution of reproductive strategies within and across taxa.
