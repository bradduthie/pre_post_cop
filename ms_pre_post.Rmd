Abstract
===================================================

Inbreeding avoidance has been widely hypothesised to evolve through pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms as a consequence of inbreeding depression in offspring viability and female multiple mating (polyandry). However, no theoretical framework exists from which to derive hypotheses concerning joint evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance necessitates polyandry, potentially leading to complex evolutionary dynamics among inbreeding strategies and female mating frequency, each of which might be affected by direct negative costs. We use individual-based modelling to quantify evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry across multiple cost combinations given severe inbreeding depression. We find that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance increases selection for polyandry, that selection for costly inbreeding strategies was weak or negligible given a non-costly alternative strategy. Established pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance generally precluded evolution of polyandry and therefore inbreeding avoidance, but established post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance from evolving. We thereby provide a general framework for understanding joint evolution of pre-copulatory and/or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and conclude that evolution of inbreeding avoidance phenotypes and associated polyandry are predicted to interact and be strongly affected by direct costs.


Introduction
===================================================

Inbreeding, defined as reproduction between relatives, often greatly reduces the fitness of resulting inbred offspring [termed 'inbreeding depression'; @Charlesworth1999; @Keller2002; @Charlesworth2009]. Such strong inbreeding depression is widely hypothesised to drive evolution of inbreeding avoidance, which can be enacted through multiple interacting reproductive strategies [@Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Pusey1996; @Szulkin2012]. From the perspective of a focal breeding female, inbreeding avoidance might be achieved by avoiding mating with related males (i.e., pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance), or by biasing fertilisation towards unrelated males after mating has occurred (i.e., post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance). Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance requires that females express some non-trivial degree of polyandry, defined as mating with multiple males during a single reproductive bout. Further, given inbreeding depression, such polyandry might itself be under selection and evolve if it allows females to mate with additional unrelated males following an initial mating with a relative. Polyandry can thereby facilitate pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance even without any post-copulatory female choice or otherwise biased fertilisation among sperm provided by females' mates (i.e., 'fair raffle'). Overall, polyandry can therefore simultaneously allow females to mate with less closely related males and create the opportunity for further inbreeding avoidance enacted through active post-copulatory choice, and has consequently been widely hypothesised to evolve as an adaptation to allow females to avoid inbreeding and thereby increase offspring fitness [@Zeh1997; @Jennions2000; @Tregenza2002]. Resulting indirect selection on polyandry could explain its evolution in cases where multiple mating does not increase female reproductive success, or even where polyandry reduces reproductive success and therefore imposes direct fitness costs to polyandrous females. However, despite such widely-invoked hypotheses, there is surprising little theory or modelling that critically examines the conditions under which pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, or both strategies, are predicted to evolve, or that examines how the evolution of such strategies of inbreeding avoidance might feed back to affect underlying evolution of polyandry.

<!--- Something seems redundant about ''sperm provided by females' mates''. This is probably okay though  --->
<!--- I think I know what you mean, but is there any reason not to be bolder than 'help explain'? Could it not entirely explain most or all of the reason for selection for polyandry in some cases? --->
<!--- I've left out survival, as decreased survival isn't really a cost unless it reduces reproductive success --->
<!--- Parker and Birkhead (2013) was cited to identify the problem of polyandry, but I've removed it here because they don't really discuss inbreeding, and there wasn't really a good way to cite them here given the edits to the text. --->

Despite the paucity of theory and resulting predictions, numerous empirical studies on diverse species have tested for, and found evidence of, female inbreeding avoidance in systems where polyandry also occurs. However, relatively few studies have determined whether inbreeding avoidance is enacted through pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mechanisms. Pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has been reported in diverse species, spanning sweet potato weevils [*Cylas formicarius*, @Kuriwada2011], purple-crowned fairy-wrens [*Malurus coronatus*, @Kuriwada2011], and a tropical butterfly [*Bicyclus anynana*, @Fischer2015], while post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has been reported in species including red junglefowl [*Gallus gallus*, @Pizzari2004] and crickets [*Teleogryllus oceanicus*, @Simmons2006; *Gryllus bimaculatus*, @Bretman2009]. Evidence for both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is available across different studies of Trinidadian guppies [*Poecilia reticulata*; @Gasparini2011; @Daniel2015] and house mice [*Mus domesticus*; @Potts1991; @Firman2015]. Meanwhile, @Liu2014 found evidence of pre-copulatory but not post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance within a single study of cabbage beetles (*Colaphellus bowringi*). However, @Ala-Honkola2011 and @Tan2012 found no evidence for pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance in fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*), respectively, and Reid et al. [-@Reid2014; -@Reid2015] found no net inbreeding avoidance in song sparrows (*Melospiza melodia*) despite strong inbreeding depression. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that diverse combinations of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occur in nature alongside polyandry. However, there is as yet no theory that predicts what combinations of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry should be favoured by selection when all combinations of phenotypes can evolve. Consequently, there is no theory that allows the diversity of existing empirical results regarding pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance to be rationalised or interpreted, and no clear hypotheses that could be tested through future empirical studies of individual systems or subsequent comparative analyses.

<!--- I don't know of any review articles or meta-analyses that look at polyandry to avoid inbreeding. At least, none within the last 10 years. --->
<!--- I'm not sure I understand the point of ''tractable systems'' for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance -- why not just 'species', as with pre-copulatory? --->
<!--- What is the difference between 'rationalised' and 'interpreted'? Do these refer to the same thing, and if so, can we get rid of 'rationalised'? --->
<!--- I still think that the end of this paragraph misses the point a bit with regard to how theory is supposed to function. --->

Developing theory on evolution of polyandry given inbreeding depression, @Duthie used a genetically-explicit individual-based model to examine the conditions under which polyandry is predicted to evolve solely due to selection stemming from pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. A recent genetically-explicit individual-based model examined the conditions under which polyandry is predicted to evolve solely due to selection stemming from pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance [@Duthie]. Evolution of polyandry occurred only under highly restricted conditions, requiring that direct negative selection (i.e., 'costs') on polyandry were small, that very few males were available for a female's initial mate choice but many were available for additional mate choice(s), or that polyandry was conditionally expressed when a focal female was related to her initial mate [@Duthie]. Without these conditions, increasing polyandry tended to increase rather than decrease the overall degree of inbreeding that females experienced, and hence reduce offspring fitness. This occurred because, once pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved, polyandrous females had already chosen available unrelated males as their initial mates. Their additional mates, chosen from the remaining male population, were therefore increasingly likely to include relatives. Evolution of polyandry purely to facilitate pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and hence the resulting degree of inbreeding avoidance, was consequently restricted [@Duthie].

<!--- I don't think 'provide initial theory' is particularly clear (i.e., 'initial' in what respect?), so I've made an edit to the first sentence, though it does seem slightly redundant in both of our cases. --->

However, if post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could also evolve, polyandrous females would also have an opportunity to bias paternity towards unrelated males within their set of chosen mates. Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might consequently reduce the cost of polyandry stemming from the accumulation of related mates across multiple matings, potentially facilitating evolution of polyandry to avoid inbreeding under broader conditions, and driving further evolution of pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mate choice strategies. However, if polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can all evolve, the long-term dynamics of these three reproductive strategies become difficult to predict. Strong inbreeding depression might drive initial evolution of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry. However, the co-occurence of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might engender some degree of 'degeneracy', defined as a phenomenon by which different elements of a system result in identical outputs [i.e., @Edelman2001]. Consequently, if evolution of polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance renders pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance functionally redundant, or vice versa, then only one inbreeding avoidance strategy might be maintained in the long-term.

<!--- the 'polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance' seems technically off. It relies on readers to recognise that 'inbreeding avoidance' only applies to the first two items in the list. I suspect this shouldn't be a problem in practice, but I wonder if there's a better way to word this  ---> 

<!--- Regarding the removal of 'conceptualise', are we suggesting then that prediction is only or most important thing to predict in the long term, and that we can do it with our model? I'm not sure if I agree with either. --->

The few previous models that considered the evolution of inbreeding avoidance through mate choice (as opposed to dispersal) have implicitly or explicitly considered the fate of a rare allele underlying pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance in a population initially fixed for random mating [e.g., @Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Duthie; @Duthie2016a]. Such models are useful for isolating the invasion fitness of this single strategy. However, when both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory strategies can affect the realised degree of inbreeding, it cannot be assumed that both strategies will simultaneously invade a randomly mating population, nor that the invasion fitness of one strategy will be independent of the pre-existence or invasion fitness of the other strategy. For example, if pre-adaptation or a selective sweep results in fixation of alleles underlying pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, then new alleles underlying polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might be unlikely to invade a population because the phenotypic effect of such alleles on the overall degree of inbreeding, and resulting indirect selection, could be negligible. Conversely, fixation of alleles underlying polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might reduce or eliminate positive selection on alleles underlying pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and hence impede adaptive evolution of mate choice. New theory, guided by modelling that evaluates invasion dynamics of alleles underlying multiple interacting and potentially functionally redundant (i.e., `degenerate') traits, is therefore needed.

<!--- I'm not entirely sure the 'resulting indirect selection' helps --->

<!--- I've made the suggested hedging changes. I originally introduced things boldly with 'preclude' or 'eliminate' by themselves as a way to introduce readers to the idea of the logic in the strongest terms possible, without thinking that readers would try to draw definite conclusions in the introduction or dwell on exceptions. Of course, as with anything in biology, the empirical (or even IBM) reality is going to be messier.  --->

<!--- Along the lines of the above then, I don't think it's always helpful to use 'evolution' as a short-hand for when we mean 'adaptive evolution'. For example, elimation of positive selection on alleles might not 'impede evolution' at all (which will still happen as long as there is mutation, drift, etc.), but rather change the direction of evolution. --->

<!--- I don't understand why 'the simultaneous' invasion dynamics was being emphasised. Isn't the point of invasion analysis to look at one thing at a time and see whether or not the trait can invade (this is what we talk about in this paragraph, at least, and what we do later). By constraints, I mean something to the effect of *not having everything start out at zero and evolve simultaneously, which is biologically unrealistic*.--->

<!--- I still don't like this last sentence very much. It doesn't really explain *why* new theory is needed, nor why such a specific set of modelling assumptions are required to address the theoretical question. I'm not even sure that I see a clear theoretical question in there. --->

Ultimately, the absolute and relative frequencies of alleles underlying pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry will depend not only on the magnitudes of positive indirect selection stemming from reduced inbreeding depression in females' offspring, but also on the magnitudes of direct negative selection on resulting phenotypes (i.e., the direct fitness costs of expressing each reproductive strategy). Polyandrous females can pay costs of mate searching or mating, for example, because these activities increase predation risk [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Ronkainen1994; @Koga1998]. Females that express pre-copulatory choice and consequent reluctance to mate with relatives might pay costs of increased risk of complete mating failure or harm caused by sexual conflict [@Rowe1994; @Kokko2013]. Females that express post-copulatory choice might pay initial energetic costs associated with developing the physiological or biochemical mechanisms needed to store sperm and successfully bias fertilisation [e.g., @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Fitzpatrick2014b]. If the relative costs of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance differ, then alleles underlying the less costly strategy might become fixed over generations, while alleles underlying the more costly inbreeding strategy might become extinct if their effects are both costly and made redundant by the less costly strategy. However, such trajectories will also depend on the indirect benefits of each strategy, which might also differ and vary in relation to the evolution of the other strategy. Dynamic models that track the frequencies of alleles underlying multiple reproductive strategies that might influence each other's evolution across generations, and that are enacted among relatives that themselves result from reproductive strategies and inbreeding depression expressed in previous generations, are consequently useful to understand and predict evolutionary outcomes.

<!--- Do we really need ''absolute and relative'' frequencies? This just gets me thinking about the distinction and why it might be important, but we don't actually talk about that here. ---> 

<!--- I think that the addition to the last sentence here is probably an improvement, but it still doesn't quite address my question -- there's not much of an argument for concluding that dynamic models are *required*. The implicit argument seems to be something like, ''look, there's a lot of complex stuff that's happening here; we can't figure out how to model how the evolutionary trajectories will play out without a dynamic model, so we're just going to assume that it's not possible''. My tendency is to be careful with these kinds of things, and maybe instead emphasise that dynamic models *can be useful* for understanding these kinds of dynamics without suggesting that they are necessary (time will tell if this is true). --->

We use individual-based modelling to address three key questions regarding evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry given strong inbreeding depression. First, does evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitate evolution of polyandry that is otherwise severely constrained from increasing relatedness of additional mates? Second, how do costs associated with polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance affect evolutionary outcomes and, in particular, the long-term persistence of reproductive strategies given cost asymmetry? Third, how is selection for initially rare pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance affected if the other strategy of inbreeding avoidance is already fixed? By addressing these questions, we illustrate how the simultaneous evolution of multiple interacting degenerate reproductive strategies can generate diverse evolutionary outcomes; we thereby provide a framework for deriving hypotheses amenable to empirical tests within and across taxa.

<!--- the 'outcomes; we' replaces the 'outcomes and' just to avoid making it sound like the second part of the sentence follows just from 'diverse evolutionary outcomes' instead of the whole first part. --->

******************************

Model
===================================================

We model evolution of polyandry, and of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, by tracking the dynamics of alleles underlying reproductive strategies enacted by interacting females and males within a small focal population. We thereby tracked evolutionary dynamics given internally-consistent patterns of relatedness caused by non-random mating while also allowing mutation, gene flow, drift, and selection to potentially affect evolution. Each individual has 10 diploid loci, and therefore 20 alleles, underlying each of the three reproductive strategy traits (i.e., 30 diploid loci in total): tendency for polyandry ($P_{a}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($M_{a}$, i.e., 'mating' alleles), and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($F_{a}$, i.e., 'fertilisation' alleles). All alleles can take any real number [i.e., a continuum-of-alleles model; @Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Reeve2000; @Bocedi2014] and combine additively to affect genotypes ($P_{g}$, $M_{g}$, and $F_{g}$) and phenotypes ($P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$) for each of the three traits whereby an individual's genotypic values $P_{g}$, $M_{g}$, and $F_{g}$ equal the sum of its 20 alleles for each trait. In overview, each generation proceeds with females paying costs, expressing polyandry, mating, and fertilisation. Offspring inherit a randomly sampled allele from each parent at each locus with no physical linkage. Alleles can then mutate and offspring express inbreeding depression in viability. Immigrants arrive in the population and density regulation limits population growth. We record the population pedigree and directly calculate the coefficient of kinship ($k$) between all potential mates in each generation (defined as the probability that two homologous alleles will be identical-by-descent), allowing individual strategies of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance to be enacted. Key individual traits, parameter values, and variables are described in Table 1.

<!--- Avoided 'used an IBM' to prevent the redundancy of 'used an IBM to model'--->

<!--- I have added a sentence like that suggested, hitting the key evolutionary processes (as all pop-geneticists will recognise these as fundamental, emphasising that we're accounting for all the possible ways evolution can occur). It's tempting to remove 'gene-flow', which we only really use to prevent kinships from getting too high, but without it it sounds as if we're leaving something out. I don't see why this deals with the concern in the intro though -- the sentence just says what we did; it doesn't really explain why we *needed* to do what we did to address the knowledge gap. --->

Costs
----------------------------------------------

Phenotypic values for tendency for polyandry ($P_{p}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($M_{p}$), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($F_{p}$) each have costs that are assumed to independently increase the probability that a focal female will die before mating (see Discussion for consideration of other costs). The probabilities of pre-mating mortality due to the costs of polyandry ($c_{P}$), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($c_{M}$), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy ($c_{F}$) are $P_{p} \times c_{P}$, $|M_{p}| \times c_{M}$, and $|F_{p}| \times c_{F}$, respectively. Here $|M_{p}|$ and $|F_{p}|$ are the absolute values of $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$, respectively. Absolute values are used for applying costs to inbreeding strategies because both negative and positive $M_{p}$ and $F_{p}$ values affect the degree of inbreeding. In contrast, only positive values of $P_{p}$ cause females to be polyandrous (see below). Overall, because generations are non-overlapping, a female's probability of total reproductive failure increases linearly with each trait value.

<!--- One issue with the 'see Discussion' though is that it's not clear what we're telling readers to see the discussion *about*. Were I to read this as reviewer, I would be confused, ''see Discussion? What for? Because you made an assumption in a model, the biological context of which was already explained in the Introduction? (2nd to last paragraph)''. I've tried to provide a bit of context in parentheses, but it makes me nervous catering to any (mistaken) readers who might be confused about what assumptions are used for in models. I'd rather deal with confused reviewers than write a paper that perpetuates some (increasingly frustrating) misunderstandings of modelling and theory.  --->

Polyandry
----------------------------------------------

After costs are paid, each remaining female chooses $N_{males}$ males to mate with, where $N_{males}$ is calculated by sampling from a Poisson distribution such that $N_{males} = Poisson(P_{p}) + 1$. This ensures that all surviving females choose at least one mate, and causes some stochastic variation around the expected mean $N_{males}$ of $P_{p}+1$. A female's value of $P_{p}$ depends on the sum of her 20 $P_{a}$ allele values (i.e., $P_{g}$), which might be negative or positive. However, because females cannot mate with a negative number of males, $P_{p}$ is constrained to be zero or positive such that $P_{p} = 0$ when $P_{g} < 0$, but $P_{p} = P_{g}$ when $P_{g} \geq 0$. Polyandry is therefore modelled as a threshold trait [@Lynch1998; @Roff1996; @Roff1998; @Duthie] that is influenced by continuous genetic variation but only expressed when $P_{g} > 0$. Any negative $P_{g}$ value therefore generates phenotypic monandry, while positive $P_{g}$ values can lead to different degrees of realised polyandry (i.e., different numbers of mates, $N_{males}$).

Mating and pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance
----------------------------------------------

All males in the population are assumed to be available for any female to choose. We therefore assume that there is no opportunity cost of male mating such that mating with one female does not reduce a male's availability to mate with any other female. Individual females mate with their total allotment of $N_{males}$ without replacement, meaning that $N_{males}$ models a female's total number of different mates rather than solely her total number of matings.

Most often, $N_{males}$ will be smaller than the total number of available males [@Duthie]. Each female then chooses her $N_{males}$ mates based on her pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance phenotype ($M_{p}$), which equals her genotype ($M_{g}$). Negative or positive $M_{p}$ values cause a female to avoid or prefer mating with kin, respectively, whereas $M_{p}=0$ cause females to mate randomly with respect to kinship.

To calculate the probability that a focal female $i$ mates with a male $j$ to whom she is related by some kinship $k_{ij}$, each male is first assigned a perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$. If the female has a strategy of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($M_{p}<0$), then $Q^{m}_{ij} = (-M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$, meaning that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ decreases linearly with increasingly positive values of $k_{ij}$ and increasingly negative values of $M_{p}$. If the female has a strategy of pre-copulatory inbreeding preference ($M_{p}>0$), then $Q^{m}_{ij} = M_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$, meaning that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ increases with increasingly positive $k_{ij}$ and $M_{p}$. If $M_{p}=0$, then all males are assigned $Q^{m}_{ij}=1$.

Each male's value with respect to each focal female is then divided by the sum of all $Q^{m}_{ij}$ values across all males with respect to that female, thereby assigning each male a relative perceived quality $q^{m}_{ij}$, which is constrained to values between zero and one. The value of $q^{m}_{ij}$ then defines the probability that a focal female mates with the male. Mating is realised by placing each $q^{m}_{ij}$ value into a vector whose elements sum to unity. A new vector of identical size is then created where each element equals the summation of all earlier position elements in the original vector of $q^{m}_{ij}$ values (such that the first element is zero and last is a number $\leq 1$). Because each element in the vector corresponds to a unique male, a random uniform number between zero and one can identify a female's realised mate. This realisation is enacted by identifying the element in the vector that is closest to, but not less than, the random uniform number. Mating is therefore stochastic, and females do not always mate with the male of the highest $q^{m}_{ij}$. For polyandrous females that choose multiple mates (i.e., $N_{mates}>1$), mates are chosen iteratively such that $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and $q^{m}_{ij}$ are re-calculated for each additional mate choice, and with $Q^{m}_{ij}$ and therefore $q^{m}_{ij}$ values of already chosen males set to zero to ensure mate sampling without replacement. In the unlikely event that a female's $N_{males}$ exceeds the total number of available males, then she simply mates with all males.

<!--- We might want to step back a bit on this one and figure out what exactly it is that is confusing and needs clarifying, as I'm not sure I see what the issue is anymore or, rather, why we're going into so much detail about a very routine procedure in an IBM (or any bit of code, really). This kind of sampling procedure was used in both of our previous IBM papers and I don't recall it being an issue. I have explained the procedure as carefully as I can, but it's getting to the point now where it's essentially turning the specifics of the C programming language into English (i.e., the methods here are now language dependent -- could be done differently in R or Perl or whatever, essentially just to say that we're sampling an element randomly from a weighted vector (I'm still not sure why we can't go back to just saying it that way; actually, I don't see why we can't just stop after ''the value of q^m_ij then defines the probability that a focal female mates with the male'' -- why does this need further explanation in the text?)). --->

Fertilisation and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance
----------------------------------------------

Following mating, fertilisation occurs such that each of a female's $n$ offspring is independently assigned a sire (with replacement) from the $N_{males}$ with which the female mated. Sire identity depends on female's kinship with each mate ($k_{ij}$) and her post-copulatory inbreeding strategy phenotype ($F_{p}$), which equals her genotype ($F_{g}$). Negative and positive values of $F_{p}$ correspond to post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance or preference, respectively, whereas $F_{p}=0$ causes random fertilisation with respect to kinship. 

The probability that an offspring of a focal female $i$ is sired by any one of $i$'s mates $j$ is calculated by assigning a perceived fertilisation quality to each $j$ with respect to $i$, $Q^{f}_{ij}$. Perceived fertilisation quality $Q^{f}_{ij}$ is calculated in the same way as perceived mate quality $Q^{m}_{ij}$, such that if a focal female has a strategy of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance ($F_{p}<0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = (-F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1)^{-1}$. If the focal female has strategy of post-copulatory inbreeding preference ($F_{p}>0$), then the perceived quality of male $j$ is $Q^{f}_{ij} = F_{p} \times k_{ij} + 1$. A relative quality ($q^{f}_{ij}$) is then calculated for each male by dividing his $Q^{f}_{ij}$ by the sum of the $Q^{f}_{ij}$ values across all of a female's mates. These $q^{f}_{ij}$ values, which lie between zero and one, define the probability of paternity. As with mate choice, one vector element representing a single male is samplied as weighted by these probabilities to determine paternity. Females produce $n$ offspring, so $q^{f}_{ij}$ values are sampled $n$ times independently and with replacement for each female to determine the realised distribution of sires. 

<!--- I've tried another way of explaining that sampling is done from a vector of probabilities in the second to last sentence here --->

Mutation
----------------------------------------------

Offsprings' alleles mutate with independent probabilities $\mu=0.001$. When a mutation occurs, a mutation effect is sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of $\mu_{SD}$ and added to the original allele value [@Kimura1965; @Lande1976; @Bocedi2014; @Duthie]. The value of $\mu_{SD}$ is set to $\sqrt{1/20}$.

Inbreeding depression
----------------------------------------------

The viability of a focal female $i$'s offspring ($\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$) decreases as a log-linear function of her kinship with the sire $j$ of her offspring ($k_{ij}$) and inbreeding depression slope $\beta$,
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\textrm{off}} = e^{-\beta k_{ij}}
\end{equation}
Here, $\beta$ models the number of haploid lethal equivalents that exist as deleterious recessive alleles in the gametes of $i$ and $j$, and which might be homozygous in offspring and reduce viability. Equation 1 assumes independent allelic effects, generating multiplicative effects on offspring viability [@Morton1956; @Mills1994]. We model inbreeding depression as having an absolute rather than relative effect on offspring viability (i.e., hard rather than soft selection), so that the effect of $\beta$ is consistent across generations and different parameter combinations. We also assume that inbreeding always decreases offspring viability (i.e., $\beta > 0$, no outbreeding depression). Therefore, because $0 \leq k_{ij} \leq 1$, $-\beta \times k_{ij} \leq 0$. Values of $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ must therefore be between zero (if $-\beta \times k_{ij}$ is very negative) and one (if $-\beta \times k_{ij} = 0$). We therefore define $\Psi_{\textrm{off}}$ as the probability that an offspring is viable, and sample its realised viability (versus mortality) using a Bernoulli trial.

<!--- See the PDF for the equation. Not sure why it's not showing up in the DOCX. --->

Immigration
----------------------------------------------

After offspring mortality, $\rho$ adult immigrants are added to the focal population. The kinship between an immigrant and all other individuals always equals zero ($k_{ij}=0$). Immigration therefore prevents the mean kinship within the population from asymptoting to one over generations. To ensure that immigrants do not directly affect genotypic or phenotypic values of tendency for polyandry or pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, immigrants are always male. Consequently, they can be chosen as females' mates based on their values of $k_{ij}=0$ but do not actively affect reproductive decisions through the expression of $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, or $F_{p}$. Further, immigrants' $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, and $F_{a}$ allele values are randomly sampled from normal distributions with means and standard deviations equal to those in the focal population at the time of immigration, meaning that they do not directly cause any change in the distribution of allele values. We thereby effectively assume that the focal population receives immigrants from other nearby populations that are subject to the same selection on $P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$.

Density regulation
----------------------------------------------

To avoid unrestricted population growth, we set separate carrying capacities for the total numbers of females ($K_{f}$) and males ($K_{m}$) in the focal population following immigration [@Guillaume2009; @Duthie]. If at the end of a generation the number of females or males exceeds $K_{f}$ or $K_{m}$  respectively, then individuals are randomly removed until each sex is at its carrying capacity. Such removal can be interpreted as some combination of dispersal and mortality. The remaining females and males form the next generation of potentially breeding adults.

Simulation and analysis
----------------------------------------------

To address whether or not evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can facilitate evolution of polyandry, we compare simulations in which polyandry and pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance can all evolve, with otherwise identical simulations in which post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance cannot evolve given four different costs of polyandry ($c_{P} = \{0, 0.0025, 0.005,  0.01\}$). To prevent post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance from evolving, we sever the connection from $F_{a}$ to $F_{p}$ such that all $F_{g}$ genotypes cause random fertilisation with respect to kinship, so $F_{a}$ alleles have no phenotypic effect.

To address how asymmetric costs associated with pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry affect the long-term persistence of reproductive strategies, we quantify the change in $M_{a}$ and $F_{a}$ over generations in simulations where the cost of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy $c_{M}=0$ but the cost of post-copulatory inbreeding strategy $c_{F}=0.02$, and vice versa. We compare these simulations with evolution of a costly strategy in the absence of evolution of an alternative strategy (e.g., evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy when post-copulatory inbreeding strategy phenotype is fixed at zero, $F_{p}=0$). In Supporting Information, we present results for all possible cost combinations of $0$ and $0.02$. Previous modelling using similar genetic architecture suggests that a cost of $0.02$ imposes strong but not overhwleming direct negative selection on polyandry [@Duthie].

To address how selection on an initially rare strategy of pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is affected by the other strategy of inbreeding avoidance already being fixed, we first used exploratory simulations to quantify evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy, and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy and associated polyandry, in isolation. Then, to test whether pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance would evolve when adaptive polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance were fixed, we initiated $M_{a}$ allele values at zero, but fixed $F_{a}$ allele values at $-10$ and $P_{a}$ allele values at $1$ (i.e., meaning that $F_{p}$ and $P_{p}$ did not evolve). Similarly, to test whether post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance would evolve when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was already fixed, we initiated $F_{a}$ and $P_{a}$ allele values at zero but fixed $M_{a}$ allele values at $-10$. Consequently, because females have 10 diploid loci, when $M_{a}$ or $F_{a}$ alleles were fixed at $-10$, outbred females were $51$ times less likely to choose a full brother and $13.5$ times times less likely to choose a first cousin than a non-relative in pre-copulatory and post-copulatory choice, respectively.

In all simulations, we recorded mean values of $P_{a}$, $M_{a}$, and $F_{a}$ in each generation, and we present these values over generations to infer selection on phenotypes ($P_{p}$, $M_{p}$, and $F_{p}$). Each combination of parameter values simulated was replicated $40$ times, and grand mean values and standard errors of means are calculated in each generation across replicates. These analyses allowed us to infer how allele values changed over generations in response to costs, but also in response to the changing values of other alleles and therefore potential evolutionary feedbacks among reproductive strategies (e.g., selection on post-copulatory inbreeding strategy might be weak if polyandry is rare). For all replicates, we set the maximum number of generations to 40000, which exploratory simulations and previous modelling [@Duthie] showed to be sufficient for inferring long-term dynamics of mean allele values and therefore selection on phenotypes.  For all replicates, we set $\rho=5$ immigrants, which produced a range of kin and non-kin in each generation allowing females to express inbreeding strategies, and $n=8$ offspring, which was sufficient to keep populations consistently at carrying capacities and avoid population extinction. Values of $K_{f}$ and $K_{m}$ were both set to 100 because previous modelling showed that populations of this size are small enough that mate encounters between kin occur with sufficient frequency for selection on inbreeding strategy, but not so small that selection is typically overwhelmed by genetic drift [@Duthie2016a].

Results
===================================================


Does evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitate evolution of costly polyandry?
----------------------------------------------

When post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alleles ($F_{a}$) were fixed to zero, meaning that $F_{p}$ could not evolve, $P_{a}$ alleles underlying polyandry always decreased to negative values over generations (red lines, Figure 1A,C,E,G). This shows that despite strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, there is selection against unconditional polyandry even given zero direct cost ($c_{P}=0$; Figure 1A). This is because $M_{a}$ values became negative over generations, meaning that females typically avoided inbreeding through their initial mating (blue lines, Figure 1A,C,E,G). Polyandrous females that subsequently sampled more males from the available population were consequently more likely to mate with some relatives and hence produce some inbred offspring with low viability [@Duthie]. 

When post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was allowed to evolve, mean $P_{a}$ values became substantially higher than in comparable simulations where $F_{a}$ values were fixed to zero and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could not evolve (Figure 1B,D,F,H). Allowing evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance alongside pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance therefore facilitated evolution of polyandry. However, $P_{a}$ values were expected to become positive only given a low cost of polyandry ($c_{P} < 0.005$, Figure 1B,D versus 1F,H). This implies that, even given strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, inbreeding avoidance might generally be a weak force driving polyandry evolution.

<!--- I've not added the suggested ''to the degree that most females mated multiply'' because it's not actually true unless costs are less than or equal to 0.025. Also, do we really need to point out figure 2 here? The very next paragraph explains that the degree of polyandry isn't trivial, and I should hope that readers aren't so impatient or put off by Figure 1 that they stop reading entirely!  --->

Strong post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, manifested as very negative $F_{a}$ values, consistently evolved in all simulations where such evolution was allowed (black lines, Figure 1B,D,F,H). Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurred even when $P_{a}$ values were expected to be slightly negative, and hence when there was selection against polyandry, (Figure 1F,H). This reflects the threshold nature of phenotypic expression of polygenic polyandry, wherein random sampling of alleles means that polyandry is expressed expressed by some females (i.e., $P_{g}>0$) even when mean $P_{a}$ values are negative (Figure 2C,D). This means that, even in populations where female reproductive strategy evolves toward monandry, there is still commonly some opportunity for expression of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated selection that drives evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance.

<!--- I'm not sure what aspects of Figure 1 you want me to mention in the main text? Are these things that are also in the legend, and if so, do we really need to repeat them? --->

Strong pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved (i.e., $M_{a}<0$) in all simulations, irrespective of $c_{P}$ and irrespective of whether post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was allowed to evolve or hence whether polyandry evolved (Figure 1). This might be expected given strong inbreeding depression in offspring viability, which imposes selection against inbreeding.

How do cost asymmetries affect long-term persistence of reproductive strategies?
----------------------------------------------

When post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance allele values ($F_{a}$) were fixed to zero, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved even when costly (Figure 3A). Likewise, when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance allele values ($M_{a}$) were fixed to zero, costly post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved (Figure 3C). Females therefore evolved to avoid inbreeding, and thereby avoid the cost of producing inbred offspring, through whichever route was available. 

<!--- Last time we were through this, it was suggested that I scrap the former term ''inbreeding strategy'' because we don't deal at all with inbreeding preference. I have rewritten these sections in attempt to make the writing clearer. TODO: Additionally, I have tweaked the figure legends appropriately.--->

However, when both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could evolve, their relative evolutionary dynamics depended on their relative costs. When pre-copulatory but not post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was costly ($c_{M}=0.02$ and $c_{F}=0$), pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance initially evolved (i.e., negative $M_{a}$) but then evolved back towards random mating (i.e., $M_{a}=0$) following increasing evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3B). Similarly, when post-copulatory but not pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was costly ($c_{F}=0.02$ and $c_{M}=0$), post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance intially evolved ($F_{a}=0$) before returning to random fertilisation after ca $20000$ generations (Figure 3D).

Evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitated evolution of polyandry (Figure 3B,C). In the absence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, polyandry did not evolve (Figure 3A,D; polyandry was cost free in all these simulations).

How do evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance affect one another?
----------------------------------------------

When polyandry alleles ($P_{a}$) were fixed to be positive so that all females were expected to mate multiply and post-copulatory inbreeding allele ($F_{a}$) values were fixed for adaptive inbreeding avoidance, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance evolved (i.e., $M_{a}$ values became increasingly negative; Figure 4A). Such evolution still occurred, but to a much smaller degree, when pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was costly (Figure 4B). However, after $40000$ generations, $M_{a}$ values were less negative when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry were fixed at non-zero values than when they also evolved from initial values of zero ($-15.45$ vs. $-17.62$; compare the blue lines in Figures 4A versus Figure 1B). This shows that fixation of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance weakens selection for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance.

<!--- Mean pre-cop value is -17.62444  in Figure 1B --->
<!--- Mean pre-cop value is -15.44786  in Figure 4A --->

<!--- I know I've mentioned this too many times, but I'm really not a fan of this kind of quantitative statistic because it doesn't really mean anything in the context of a model like this. At the very least though, I think it's better to put the actual numbers up because ''X% less negative'' just seems very confusing to me. --->

<!--- I added this last sentence for summary, but stopped it a bit earlier than the suggestion because I'm not sure where you were going with it. If we know how selection is changed, isn't this the point? Evolution more broadly encompasses mutation and drift, but we've not changed either of these so why do we need to say 'weakens selection' and therefore evolution was affected? --->

Conversely, when pre-copulatory inbreeding allele ($M_{a}$) values were fixed for adaptive inbreeding avoidance, mean $F_{a}$ allele values did not consistently become negative over generations (Figure 4C,D). Fixation of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance therefore prevented evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. However, in this case, mean $P_{a}$ allele values consistently decreased over generations, reflecting selection against polyandry regardless whether or not post-copulatory inbreeding strategy was costly (Figure 4C,D). Consequently, when $c_{F}=0$, $F_{a}$ allele values had no effect because females were almost exclusively monandrous, resulting in high drift of $F_{a}$ values among replicates (illustrated by wide standard errors, Figure 4C). However, when $c_{F}=0.02$, $F_{a}$ values remained near zero to minimise direct costs. This lack of selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was driven by a lack of polyandry, and therefore an inability of females to bias fertilisation among multiple mates. When pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry were both fixed ($M_{a}=-10$ and $P_{a}=1$), $F_{a}$ allele values evolved to similarly negative means as $M_{a}$ allele values in Figure 4A,B (see Supporting Information).

Discussion

<!--- ==================================================================== --->

<!--- Evolution of reproductive strategies involves multiple potentially interacting and degenerate phenotypes. Here we modelled evolution of three reproductive strategies including polyandry, pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, focusing on three key questions. Using individual-based modelling, we found that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance facilitated evolution of polyandry, that evolution of a costly inbreeding avoidance strategy was inhibited when the other inbreeding avoidance strategy was cost free, and that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance but not pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was precluded when the other inbreeding avoidance strategy was fixed for strong inbreeding avoidance. We thereby conclude that evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies and associated polyandry are likely to interact in predictable ways, potentially generating new hypotheses concerning evolution of reproductive strategies within and across taxa. --->

<!---  I think these changes have been good ones, and hence that we’re heading along decent lines with the Discussion. However I think it could to with a moderately hefty edit to 1) tidy up some overarching points about what we did near the start, 2) perhaps clarify the structure of the Discussion in relation to the three questions that are now very clearly stated at the end of the Intro, and 3) tighten up the writing a bit (I can tell that the Discussion is a few iterations behind the rest of the manuscript in terms of tight and precise writing, but that’s easily fixed once we get the structure sorted). --->

<!--- Unusually for me (and sorry if this opening was my suggestion from an earlier draft!), I’m wondering whether it’s a good idea to start this broad, or whether we’d be better to keep a bit more focused to start with, and then bring in the generality after that? I’ll make some suggestions, see what you think. Writing is NOT intended to be a definitive version, just me getting some ideas down!  --->

<!--- I do think we need to get this into the start of the Discussion. It’s because our current analyses don’t play around with the magnitude of ID, it’s a fixed parameter = strong. Think we need to make sure that’s clear in peoples’ minds, otherwise we’ll get people asking about IP etc... Hence my suggestion to nail it at the start – which then mirrors the start of the Intro. --->

<!--- Too much/too vague no doubt – but this is a hanger to link back to the bit you flagged up as a worry in the Intro, about whether someone would query why we need ‘dynamic models’ – so here we could flag up the dynamicism again somehow? --->

<!--- To me, this sentence isn’t very helpful, doesn’t say what the questions are or what we concluded, or even how we tackled them, so it seems pretty redundant. Can we weave into next section along lines suggested? --->

<!--- SUGGESTED CHANGE: Strong inbreeding depression in offspring fitness is widely hypothesised to drive evolution of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and hence drive evolution of polyandry [@Zeh1997; @Jennions2000; @Tregenza2002]. However, evolution of such degenerate (i.e. functionally overlapping) mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance cannot be presumed to occur independently, meaning that emerging reproductive strategies are likely to be shaped by relative costs, and might exhibit complex dynamic evolutionary feedbacks across multiple generations. --->

<!--- I was wondering about reiterating a clearer KG here, but actually I think it’s fine without – see comment attached to end of this suggested paragraph. --->

<!--- One of my main comments about the Discussion at the moment is that the really clear structure of the 3 questions that’s now set up at the end of the Intro and followed through the Methods and Results has completely disappeared here. Can we get it back again, a bit? Restating the questions here might be overkill, but yet I’m thinking that a short summary version might be helpful – something like this? --->

<!--- I didn’t get much from this here, and anyway you pretty much repeat the exact same thing in the ‘conclusions’ section at the end? So, if we have to have a conclusions section (for JEB?), then I think it’s best there? --->

<!--- This sentence might need tweaking a bit, but I think something like it would be a good strong end to this first para? --->

<!--- So this is where I start to find the structure of the Discussion a bit hard to follow – seem to be addressing the three questions in reverse order. This first bit (and the link to fig 4), is really addressing question 3, isn’t it? And then we go on to Q2 (fig 3) and then finally Q1 (fig 1). This is pretty confusing. Would it be possible to turn this section around so that the three questions are dealt with in the ‘right’ order? I haven’t tried to implement. Or if you want to keep it like this we might need to clarify that structure and (implicitly or explicitly) note why things are reversed? --->

Evolution of reproductive strategies cannot be presumed to occur in isolation in wild populations, and is instead likely to involve multiple interacting phenotypes resulting in the potential for feedback and degeneracy (i.e., functional redundance) among phenotypes under selection. For example, strong inbreeding depression in offspring fitness is widely hypothesised to drive selection for inbreeding avoidance, which could consequently feed back to drive selection for polyandry [e.g., @Zeh1997; @Jennions2000; @Tregenza2002]. Evolution of inbreeding avoidance can be driven by selection on both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms, so simultaneous evolution of each phenotype is likely to be affected by degeneracy, in addition to any direct costs on phenotypes. We used individual-based modelling to explore evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry given (1) hard constraints on evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, (2) asymmetric costs of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, and (3) evolution of one inbreeding avoidance phenotype given the pre-existence the other. We thereby highlight fundamental but theoretically under-developed relationships between evolution of female mating frequency and pre-copulatory versus post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance.

<!--- I have tried to re-work this first paragraph, but I had a very hard time following the logical flow of ideas given the suggested changes. I understand that you want to get all of the components of this manuscript into the front of the Discussion, but I think they need to fit together much more coherently. I didn't quite understand the motivation behind the suggested changes. For example, the proposed first sentence of the Discussion shifted from talking generally about all of our results to only referring to one of our questions. I didn't understand the proposed second sentence at all, which suggested that evolution of degenerate traits can't be assumed to occur independently? (But this is trivially true -- almost by definition! And it inverts the key logic -- the point is that traits don't have independent effects *potentially leading to degeneracy*).  The next part of the proposed second sentence suggested that it necessarily follows from degeneracy that relative costs will shape reproductive interactions, but why does this have to be the case? There needs to be some logical connection between these two claims that just isn't there. I couldn't really figure out how to re-work it because I was really unclear as to what the logical progression of ideas was. Can you clarify what you mean by this? --->

<!--- I think the logic of the first sentence is important here, though it might need some tweaks. The point is that phenotypes don't occur in isolation -> multiple phenotypes interact -> two types of interaction are feedbacks and degeneracy. Hence, degeneracy is one *type* of way that phenotypes might interact, so I think that the sentence structure needs to reflect this so readers don't get confused (i.e., we can't just skip to 'such degenerate' because it doesn't clearly follow from the previous sentence. --->

<!--- I don't think just mentioning 'dynamic models' is enough to make a convincing argument that they were necessary to address the knowledge gap. If we really wanted to flesh out the idea, we would have to explain *why* we couldn't get the answer we did with non-dynamic models. This isn't obvious or trivial! --->

Evolution of polyandry
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--- I have re-ordered the Discussion to reflect the order of the questions, but this sacrifices something by putting the specifics points ahead of more general questions (i.e., those references to Figure 4 were not related to any of the three questions specifically, but were used to help make a more general point derived from a holistic understanding of the model). Hence, I have created a new section for more general points concerning reproductive strategy, also removing the conclusion. --->

The opportunity to adjust inbreeding has been widely considered as a driver of adaptive evolution of polyandry [@Tregenza2002; @Foerster2003; @Akcay2007; @Varian-Ramos2012; @Kingma2013; @Lehtonen2015; @Reid2014]. We found that when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance could evolve, selection for polyandry was greatly strengthened (Figure 1). The proposition that polyandry might facilitate cryptic female choice among males of varying compatibility is not new [e.g., @Zeh1997], but our model provides support for this verbal hypothesis and therefore has widespread implications for future studies of evolution of polyandry. 

We predict evolution of polyandry in populations where inbreeding depression is severe and inbreeding avoidance through post-copulatory mechanisms can also evolve. Post-copulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance have been observed under these conditions in experimental systems across diverse taxa [e.g., @Pizzari2004; @Firman2008; @Bretman2009; @Gasparini2011; @Tuni2013; @Firman2015]. Recent studies have shown how females can successfully bias fertilisation after mating has occurred. For example, when female guppies (*Poecilia reticulata*) were artificially inseminated with equal quantities of sperm from full-siblings and unrelated males, more eggs were fertilised by unrelated males because the velocities of full siblings' sperm were reduced by females' ovarian fluids [@Gasparini2011]. In black field crickets (*Teleogryllus commodus*), females attempt to remove the spermatophores of unwanted males after copulation, and are capable of controlling sperm transfer to spermatheca after copulation occurs [@Bussiere2006; @Tuni2013]. Our results suggest that evolution of such post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might increase selection for further polyandry, especially if pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is costly (Figure 1).

Interaction of polyandry and inbreeding avoidance strategies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurred in our model, but was affected by the joint evolution of polyandry and the existence of asymmetric costs. One cost free inbreeding strategy precluded another more costly inbreeding strategy from persisting in a focal population by modifying its effect on inbreeding avodance (Figure 3). Consequently, long-term persistence of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might not be expected in populations given sufficient cost asymmetry. Direct costs therefore strongly affected the evolution of the costly phenotype(s), meaning that quantifying costs is necessary for predicting evolution of phenotypes associated with inbreeding strategies. Quantifying direct costs of phenotypes associated with polyandry and mate choice is empirically challenging [@Pomiankowski1987; @Kokko2003; @Reid2015]. @Pomiankowski1987 categorised four types of costs that are relevant to mate choice, which we suggest are also relevant costs for polyandry, and include costs of elevated risks associated with (1) predation or (2) disease transmission, and costs incurred through (3) loss of time or (4) depletion of energy. Another type of cost relevant for polyandry and inbreeding strategy is risk of male harm caused by sexual conflict [e.g., @Arnqvist2005a; @Parker2006]. We assumed that males were passive in mating encounters with females, but inbreeding theory predicts that males should benefit from a higher tolerance of inbreeding than females, leading to sexual conflict over inbreeding [@Parker1979; @Parker2006; @Kokko2006; @Duthie2015a]. Here we interpreted a cost of polyandy as an elevated risk of predation as might be incurred while searching for or courting mates [e.g., @Rowe1988; @Rowe1994], a cost of pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy as a lost of time [i.e., risk of not finding a mate in time due to choosiness; e.g., @Kokko2013], and a cost of post-copulatory inbreeding strategy as depletion of energy. While these costs thereby reflect empirical observations in some populations and are therefore biologically realistic, other types of costs have also been observed and could therefore be considered in future models. For example, increased risk of disease transmission has been observed for highly polyandrous females [@Roberts2015a], but such a cost would more realistically be applied to the number of realised mates a female has rather than her tendency for engaging in polyandry. Different types of costs might affect selection both directly and indirectly through interactions between reproductive strategies, thereby affecting evolution of entire reproductive systems. Evolution of individual phenotypes therefore needs to be considered in the broader context of potentially interacting and phenotypes and their costs.

<!--- I don't understand the contrast between the two comments, the first of which suggests that the empirical examples of costs cited are not needed here, and the second of which suggests that we need to be more explicit about why we did things the way we did. Hence, I have revised to clarify that we made the modelling choices that we did with respect to costs *because they are observed in empirical systems*. Of course, the costs that we modelled are not the *only* kinds of 'costs' that are observed in empirical systems (hence the Roberts reference), so other models might want to look into different types of costs. I agree that it would not be at all surprising if a reviewer raised a question about how we modelled the costs (or anything else), but this always seems to be true for modelling and I think it kind of misses the big picture about how models like this try to develop theory. We can't model *every* kind of cost that we can possibly think of, and we're not modelling a specific system where we might be able to justify some costs being more reasonable than others. We also can't (I don't think) logically show with an IBM that the type of cost will be arbitray with respect to the questions of interest (i.e., any cost will do). In the end, we have to make reasonable decisions about how to model costs and work from there. I think that citing empirical studies shows that our assumptions of cost type are reasonable for some systems (though potentially not others). Had we made different assumptions, I suspect we'd get queries from some readers wondering why we didn't do it a different way. --->

In our model, existence of adaptive pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance precluded evolution of polyandry and, in turn, evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3C,D). However, existence of adaptive post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance (Figure 3A,B). In wild populations, it is unlikely that pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will evolve simultaneously from an ancestral population in which females mate and assign paternity randomly. Rather, for example, initial evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is much more likely to evolve in the absence of evolving post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance due to constraints, or in the presence of already evolved post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. When framing hypotheses for existence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and polyandry, it might therefore be necessary to consider whether or not inbreeding avoidance already occurs through pre-copulatory mate choice. Additionally, the opportunity for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance will also naturally depend on the degree to which females are polyandrous. For species in which pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance occurs and polyandry is uncommon [@Lihoreau2007; @Metzger2010; @Metzger2010a], evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is highly unlikely.

General predictions concering inbreeding avoidance and polyandry
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is useless for monandrous females, and most effective for highly polyandrous females that can choose amongst multiple mates to ensure that offspring are fertilised favourably. In contrast, pre-copulatory mechanisms are most salient for monandrous females that have no post-copulatory means for avoiding inbreeding. This theory is borne out in our simulation results, as selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was negligible in monandrous populations, resulting in high drift of allele values over generations due to the inability of females to express post-copulatory choice (e.g., Figure 4C,D). The effect of monandry on selection for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was weaker, but pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance was generally stronger when populations where monandrous (e.g., Figure 3A vs 3B; see also Supporting Information p. S1-1). In addition to polyandry increasing selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, polyandry might also covary positively with post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance due to the feed back that post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance has on facilitating evolution of polyandry itself, as observed in our model (Figure 1). It would therefore be interesting to test the hypothesis that, across taxa, occurrence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance covaries positively, and pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance covaries negatively, with degree of polyandry. To test this hypothesis, more work is needed to identify the degree to which females of different species engage in polyandry and the degree to which females express both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance.

<!---  Diluting the idea of degeneracy throughout the manuscript now makes me worry that some readers will miss it entirely. If they're not reading carefully, they'll miss (or simply forget) the buried definition in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction. Because the concept of degeneracy becomes so important later on, they'll need to back track to remember what it actually means. I'm less a fan of 'flagging' things for this reason -- readers don't really *need* to understand degeneracy completely until now, but here they have to go all the way back to the Introduction to get the full scope of its importance. --->

<!--- By removing the sentence specifying how degeneracy works with respect to inbreeding avoidance, we are asking the readers to recall these specifics from the introduction (or go back and find them again). The exact mechanism by which functional overlap occurs is removed from the more vague 'phenotypic reproductive strategies'. I'm afraid this will lose some readers who might be a bit tired by the end of the Discussion.--->

Degeneracy occurs at nearly all biological scales [@Edelman2001], including complex systems affecting organismal development [e.g., @Nowak1997], adaptation [@Whitacre2010; @Whitacre2010a], and cognition [@Price2002; @Park2013], as well as population [@Atamas2009], community [@Suraci2017], and ecosystem [e.g., @Levin2008] dynamics. In our model, degeneracy occurred through overlaps in how different reproductive strategies caused adaptive inbreeding avoidance. In general, degeneracy might increase biological robustness by fine-tuning degenerate phenotypes to different local environments [@Gardner2006; @Whitacre2010a]. For example, such degeneracy might facilitate inbreeding avoidance via pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mechanisms depending on different selective environments in which either pre-copulatory or post-copulatory mechanisms alone would be ineffective (e.g., due to sexual conflict affecting mate choice or injury affecting fertilisation). However, evolution of each of these strategies might decrease selection on the other strategy by modifying its impact on the degree to which a female avoids inbreeding and consequently has offspring that express inbreeding depression [*sensu* evolution of genetic redundancy; see @Nowak1997]. The relevance of degeneracy with respect to such reproductive strategies therefore requires further theoretical development, which could result in new empirical predictions and conceptual synthesis across biological scales.

![Mean allele values underlying tendency for polyandry (red), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy (blue), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy (black) from simulations where post-copulatory inbreeding strategy is (A, C, E, and G) fixed to zero (i.e., random fertilisation) or (B, D, F, H) allowed to evolve freely. Costs of polyandry (c_p) increase across rows from zero (A and B) to 0.01 (G and H). Mean allele values (solid lines) and associated standard errors (shading) are calculated across all individuals within a population over 40000 generations across 40 replicate populations. Negative mean allele values indicate inbreeding avoidance or tendency for monandry, and positive values indicate inbreeding preference or tendency for polyandry. Dotted lines demarcate mean allele values of zero.](figures/poly_costs.png)

![Relationships between (A and C) polyandry allele values and (B and D) monandry and polyandry phenotypes for simulations with default parameter values and zero costs. Red lines in (A) and (C) show mean polyandry allele values across all individuals in a single simulation over 40000 generations. Positive and negative allele values contribute to polyandry and monandry, respectively. In the final generation, mean allele value was below (A) or above (C) zero (demarcated by the dotted line). Nevertheless, due to the threshold nature of expression of the polygenic polyandry phenotype, polyandry and monandry are expressed in both populations. Histograms in (B) and (D) show females' tendency for polyandry phenotypes in the final generation; white and grey shading indicates monandrous and polyandrous females, respectively.](figures/Pp_vals.png)

![Mean allele values underlying tendency for polyandry (red), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy (blue), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy (black) when (A and B) costly pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy can evolve and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy is (A) fixed for random fertilisation or (B) can also evolve, and when (C and D) costly post-copulatory inbreeding strategy can evolve and pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy is (A) fixed for random mating or (B) can also evolve. Mean allele values (solid lines) and associated standard errors (shading) are calculated across all individuals within a population over 40000 generations across 40 replicate populations. Negative mean allele values reflect strategies of inbreeding avoidance or tendency for monandry, and positive values reflect strategies of inbreeding preference or tendency for polyandry. In all panels, polyandry is cost free.](figures/rel_costs.png)

![Mean allele values underlying tendency for polyandry (red), pre-copulatory inbreeding strategy (blue), and post-copulatory inbreeding strategy (black), given (A and B) fixed polyandry and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and (C and D) fixed post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance where the evolving inbreeding strategy is (A and C) cost-free or (B and D) costly. Mean allele values (solid lines) and associated standard errors (shading) are calculated across all individuals within a population over 40000 generations across 40 replicate populations. Negative mean allele values reflect strategies of inbreeding avoidance or tendency for monandry, and positive values reflect strategies of inbreeding preference or tendency for polyandry.](figures/fixed_adapt.png)
