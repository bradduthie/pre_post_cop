1. The ORCID identify is correct for A. B. Duthie

2. The given and surnames have been identified correctly

3. (+44) 01786 467843. The email is also incorrect; it should be 'alexander.duthie@stir.ac.uk'

4. This is incorrect. Reid 2015 is a single author paper. Somehow the first word of the paper (''What'') seems to have changed to a surname. The correct version should be retained as below:

Reid, J.M. 2015. What can we really say about relatedness and extrapair paternity: a comment on Arct et al. Behav. Ecol. 26:969â€“970.

5. This is correct.

6. Kokko et al. (2003) should be deleted from the reference list.

7. Sending EPS

8. Sending EPS
